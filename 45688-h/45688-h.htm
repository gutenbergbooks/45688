<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book is not a work of fiction. It is a plain
narrative of real life in the New Zealand bush, a
true story of adventure in a day not yet remote,
when adventure in abundance was still to be had
in the land of the Maori. Every name used is a
real one, every character who appears in these
pages had existence in those war days of forty
years ago. Every incident described here is a
faithful record of actual happenings; some of
them may convince the reader that truth can be
stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>Numerous instances are recorded of white deserters
from civilisation who have allied themselves
with savages, adopting barbarous practices, and
forgetting even their mother-tongue. In the old
convict days of New South Wales escapees from the
fetters of a more than rigorous "system" now and
again cast in their lot with the blacks. Renegades
of every European nationality have been found
living with and fighting for native tribes in Africa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
and America and the Islands of Polynesia. But
none of them had a wilder story to tell than has
the man whose narrative is here presented&mdash;Kimble
Bent, the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori. Ever since 1865&mdash;when
he first "took to the blanket"&mdash;he has lived with
the New Zealand Maoris. For thirteen years he
was completely estranged from his fellow-whites;
he had deserted from a British regiment and a price
was on his head. British troops and Colonial
irregulars alike hunted him and his fanatical
Hauhau companions. His hairbreadth escapes were
many; he had to risk death not only from British
bullet and bayonet, but from the savage brown
men of the forest with whom he lived. When
at last he came out of hiding, and dared once more
to face those of his own colour, he had almost
forgotten the English language, and could speak
it but with difficulty and hesitation. He has been
out of his bush exile many years, but is still living
with his Maori friends, and is still known by the
Maori name, "Tu-nui-a-moa," which his chief
Titokowaru gave him in 1868. When he writes to
me, he usually writes in Maori, and he is practically
a Maori himself, for he has lived the greater part
of his life as a Maori, and he has assimilated the
peculiar modes of thought and some of the ancient
beliefs of the natives, as well as their tongue and
customs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable portions of Bent's
narrative is his account of the revival of cannibalism
by the Hauhaus in 1868. Vague stories have been
heard concerning the eating of soldiers' bodies by
the bushmen of Ngati-Ruanui and Nga-Rauru
and of rites of human sacrifices performed in the
woods of Taranaki, but this account of Bent's is
the first detailed description from an eye-witness
of the man-eating practices in Titokowaru's camps.
Many of Tito's Hauhaus are still alive; but they
are very reticent on the subject of "long-pig."</p>

<p>I first met Kimble Bent in 1903. In that year
Mr. T. E. Donne, now the New Zealand Government
Trade Commissioner in London, had induced
the old man to come to Wellington for the purpose
of being interviewed and photographed; and it is
these interviews, very considerably expanded during
a seven years' acquaintance with Bent, and carefully
checked by independent Maori testimony, that
are now embodied in this book.</p>

<p>In confirmation and extension of Bent's story, I
have gathered data at first-hand both from Taranaki
Maoris who fought under Titokowaru, and
from soldiers and settlers who fought against him,
and these particulars are incorporated with the
old <i>pakeha</i>-Maori's narrative.</p>

<p>The 1868-9 portion of the book is, therefore,
practically a history of the Titokowaru war in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Taranaki; and it embraces a great deal of matter
not hitherto recorded.</p>

<p>Many of the settler-soldiers who survive from
those wild forest days now farm their peaceful
lands within sight of the battle-fields of Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu,
and Pungarehu, and Moturoa, and
Otapawa. With them the recollections of bush-marches
and ambuscades and storming of Hauhau
stockades are still fresh and vivid. But the younger
generation know little of the dangers and troubles
through which the pioneers passed. The available
histories deal very meagrely and often very inaccurately
with the story of the Ten-Years' Maori
War, even from the white side, while the Maori
view-point is absolutely unknown to all but a few
colonists. Therefore it is fortunate, perhaps, that
one has been enabled to gather before it is too late
from the old Hauhau warriors themselves the tale
of their ferociously patriotic past, and to place on
record this true story of wild forest life from the
lips of one of the last of that nearly extinct type
of decivilised outlander, the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori.</p>

<p>For information and assistance in regard to
various engagements in Titokowaru's war I am
indebted to Colonel W. E. Gudgeon, C.M.G., Colonel
T. Porter, C.B., and other old Colonial soldiers.
Tutangé Waionui, of Patea, who was one of Titokowaru's
most active scouts and warriors, has given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
me many details concerning the campaign from
the Maori side; and the Rev. T. G. Hammond,
Wesleyan Missionary to the Taranaki Maoris, has
also furnished assistance on the same subject. To
Mrs. Kettle, of Napier, daughter of Major von
Tempsky, I owe my thanks for permission to
reproduce three of the illustrations in this book,
copies of water-colour sketches by her celebrated
father, representing scenes in the Taranaki campaign
of 1865-6. The picture of the fight at Moturoa
in 1868 is from a black-and-white sketch by a
soldier-artist who took part in the engagement;
the original was in the possession of the late Dr.
T. M. Hocken, of Dunedin, who allowed me to
have it photographed for this book.</p>

<h2>THE ADVENTURES OF KIMBLE BENT</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE DESERTER</p>

<p class="blockquote">On the banks of the Tangahoé&mdash;The runaway soldier&mdash;A Maori
scout&mdash;Off to the rebel camp.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the banks of one of the many swift rivers that
roll down to the Tasman Sea through the Taranaki
Plains a young man in the blue undress uniform of
a private soldier sat smoking his pipe. He was
dripping with water, and a little pool had collected
where he crouched in the fern, a few feet from the
bank of the stream. He had plainly just emerged
from the river. His clothes were torn, and he was
capless. He was a man of about the middle size,
spare of build, with sharp dark eyes and a bronzed
complexion that told of past life under a tropic sun.</p>

<p>Less than an hour previously he had left his comrades'
camp, the tented lines of Her Majesty's 57th
Regiment, on the ferny flats of Manawapou. Left
unofficially, and without his arms, strolling down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
towards the Tangahoé River as if for a bathe. A
"shut-eye" sentry was on duty that morning; and
the deserter's tent-mates, too, were sympathetically
blind to his departure. The Tangahoé was the
border-line between the country covered by the
British rifles and the unconquerable bush of the Maori
rebels. Towards this rubicon he made his way
through the thick, high fern, which soon concealed
him from view. He attempted to ford the rapid,
muddy river, but it was up to his waist, and almost
swept him off his feet. Struggling ashore again, he
took to the fern and travelled slowly and with great
toil through it, keeping parallel with the course of
the Tangahoé, and heading down stream. He
forced his way through the thick fern "like a wild
pig," to use his own simile. In this way he travelled
something over a mile down the river, and then
once more attempted to ford across, but it was
too deep and swift. He crawled back up the bank
again, and quite exhausted, with scratched hands
and face and gaping half-buttonless clothes, he
sat down to recover his breath and strength. His
heart was thumping fearfully with his frantic exertions
in the closely matted, entangling fern, and
it was some minutes before he could command his
trembling fingers to fill and light his pipe.</p>

<p>After the soldier had sat and smoked a while he
rose, and making his way to a slight elevation on
the banks where he could see over the top of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
coarse <i>rarauhe</i> fern, in some places ten feet high,
he looked around him. Directly across the river
the bush began, the seemingly impenetrable forest
solemn and dark, pregnant with danger and mystery.
Turning in the other direction, and facing the north-west,
he could just discern in the distance the
tops of a number of bell-tents&mdash;the camp he had
left behind him. And as he looked his last on the
tents of his comrades and his tyrants, he heard the
sweet notes of a bugle sounding a call. The midwinter
air was very clear and still. It was the
midday mess call&mdash;"Come-to-the-cookhouse-door."</p>

<p>"No more cookhouse-door now, that's a moral,"
said the soldier aloud. "Pork and potatoes for
you, me boy&mdash;or else a crack on the head with a
tomahawk."</p>

<p>Beyond the tents, another tent-shaped object
took the soldier's eye. It was a lofty snowy mountain,
glittering in the midday sun. It was far
away in the nor'-west, so far that its base was
hidden by the intervening bush, and only the
white symmetrical upper part of the vast cone,
a wedge of white culminating in as perfect an
apex as any bell-tent, was visible to the eye from
this part of the great plains. It was the peak of
Taranaki mountain, which the white man calls
Mount Egmont.</p>

<p>Satisfying himself that there was no one in
sight and that he was not followed, the soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
squatted down again and smoked his pipe meditatively.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started up and listened intently.
He heard something, and any noise meant danger.
The sound was the trotting of a horse.</p>

<p>Scrambling through the fern a little space back
from the bank, he found that a narrow track wound
through the tangle of tall brown bracken. Peering
out from his shelter place he saw&mdash;first, the glitter
of the muzzle of a long rifle above the fern; then,
next moment round a turn in the path came a
mounted man, a Maori. He was a tall, black-bearded
fellow, wearing a European shirt and
trousers, but bare as to feet. Each stirrup-iron
was thrust between the big toe and the next one,
as was the universal Maori mode when riding
bare-footed. In his right hand he held an Enfield
rifle, of the pattern used by the white troops in
those days; the butt rested on his thigh, cavalryman
fashion. Round his shoulders hung a leather
cartouche-box; there was another buckled round
his waist, from which there hung also a revolver
in its case. A Hauhau scout, evidently, venturing
rather daringly close to the British camp.</p>

<p>The white man hesitated only a moment. Then
he boldly stepped out on to the track, directly in
front of the startled Maori, who pulled his shaggy
pony up sharp, and instantly presented his gun at
the white man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing the next moment, however, that the
white man was unarmed and alone, the Maori
brought his rifle-butt down on his leg again, and
stared with wonder at the forlorn-looking white
soldier before him.</p>

<p>"Here, you <i>pakeha</i>!" he cried, in mixed English
and Maori; "go back, quick! <i>Haere atu, haere
atu!</i> Go 'way back to t'e soldiers. I shoot you
suppose you no go! <i>Hoki atu!</i>"</p>

<p>"Shoot away!" returned the white man. "I
won't go back. I'm running away from the soldiers.
I want to go to the Maoris. Take me with you!"</p>

<p>"<i>You tangata kuwaré</i>!" the Maori said. "You
<i>pakeha</i> fool, go back! T'e Maori kill you, my
word! You look out."</p>

<p>"I don't care if they do," replied the soldier.
"I tell you, I want to live with the Hauhaus."</p>

<p>"<i>E pai ana!</i>" ("It is well"), said the scout.
"All right, you come along. But you look out
for my tribe&mdash;they kill you."</p>

<p>"I'm not frightened of your tribe," said the
soldier.</p>

<p>"What your name, <i>pakeha</i>?" was the next
question.</p>

<p>"Kimble Bent," answered the <i>pakeha</i>.</p>

<p>The Maori attempted the pronunciation of the
name, but the nearest he could get to it was "Kimara
Peneti."</p>

<p>"Too hard a name for t'e Maori," he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
"<i>Taihoa</i>; we give you more better name&mdash;good
Maori name. If"&mdash;he qualified it&mdash;"my tribe
don't kill you."</p>

<p>Then the swarthy warrior dismounted and ordered
the <i>pakeha</i> to get into the saddle; he saw that his
prisoner was dead-tired. He turned the horse's
head back towards the Maori country, and the
strangely-met pair struck down along the banks
of the Tangahoé, the Maori striding in front.</p>

<p>For about three miles the track wound down
through the fern and flax, parallel with the course
of the river. Then the travellers came to a ford.
They crossed safely, and clambering up the steep
muddy bank on the other side, they marched on
towards the blue hills of the rebel country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="center">KIMBLE BENT, SAILOR AND SOLDIER</p>

<p class="blockquote">Kimble Bent's early life&mdash;An Indian mother&mdash;Service in
the American Navy&mdash;Departure for England&mdash;"Taking the
Shilling"&mdash;British Army life&mdash;The flight to America&mdash;A sinking
ship&mdash;Rescue, and landing in Glasgow&mdash;Back to the Army
again&mdash;Soldiering in India&mdash;The 57th ordered to New Zealand&mdash;The
Taranaki Campaign&mdash;A court-martial&mdash;At the triangles.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the runaway soldier is riding on to the
camp of the brown warriors of the bush&mdash;a journey
which is to be the beginning of a wild and savage
life leading him for many a day, like Thoreau's
Indian fighter, on dim forest trails "with an uneasy
scalp"&mdash;there is time to learn something of his
previous history and adventures.</p>

<p>Perhaps the impulse that led to his passionate
revolt against civilisation and rigid army discipline
came from his American Indian blood.</p>

<p>Kimble Bent's mother was a half-caste Red
Indian girl, of the Musqua tribe, whose villages
stood on the banks of the St. Croix River, State of
Maine, U.S.A. Her English name before marriage
was Eliza Senter. She became the wife of a shipbuilder
in the town of Eastport, Maine; his name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
was Waterman Bent; he worked at first for Caleb
Houston, shipbuilder, but afterwards had a yard
of his own. This couple had seven children, two
sons and five daughters; one of these sons was
Kimble Bent. He was born in Eastport on
August 24, 1837.</p>

<p>The roving wayward element in young Kimble
Bent's blood soon made itself manifest. When he
was about seventeen, he ran away from home and
went to sea. He shipped on a United States
man-of-war, the training frigate <i>Martin</i>, and spent
three years aboard her, cruising along the Atlantic
Coast. He quickly became a smart young sailor
and gunner, and from the rank of seaman he
graduated to deckman, a sort of quartermaster.
It was part of his duty during the last year of his
service to instruct the boys who came aboard as
recruits in the working of the muzzle-loading
6-pounder and 8-pounder guns.</p>

<p>Paid off from his frigate at the end of his three
years, Bent returned to his people as unexpectedly
as he had left them. But he didn't stay in Eastport
long. The prosaic life of the old town was no more
to his liking than when first he had run away to
follow a sailor's life; so he soon took to the seas
again. He gathered together what money he
could&mdash;a considerable sum, he says, for his father
was indulgent&mdash;and took ship across the Atlantic,
in his head some such unexpressed sentiment as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Robert Louis Stevenson long afterwards put into
verse in his "Songs of Travel":</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"The untented Kosmos my abode</div>
      <div class="verse indent-2">I go, a wilful stranger,</div>
      <div class="verse indent-2_6">My mistress still the open road</div>
      <div class="verse indent-2">And the bright eyes of Danger."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But no man-of-war life for him. He booked his
passage in a barque sailing for Liverpool, resolved
to see something of life in the Old World.</p>

<p>When he landed in the big city he "made himself
flash," to use his own expression, and went the
pace with a few like-minded young fellows, and one
way and another his stock of cash soon vanished,
and he found himself stranded, friendless, and
alone&mdash;his companions of the "flush" times had
no more use for him. One day, as he wandered
disconsolate along the streets, his eye was taken by
the scarlet tunic and lively bearing of a smart
recruiting-sergeant, and on the impulse of the
moment he took the Queen's shilling and was enlisted
in Her Majesty's 57th Regiment of Foot.
This was in the year 1859.</p>

<p>The young Eastport sailor soon bitterly regretted
the day that his eye was dazzled by the Queen's
scarlet. The British Army was less to his taste
than life in Uncle Sam's Navy. He was sent to
Cork with a draft of two hundred other recruits,
and the interminable drill soon gave him an intense
disgust for the routine of barrack-yard instruction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Four months of recruit-drill&mdash;then one day Private
Bent took a stroll down the Cork wharves and cast
his eyes round for a likely craft in which to give
the army, drill-sergeants, and all the slip.</p>

<p>A Boston barque, the <i>Maria</i>, happened to be
lying at one of the tees, and her skipper, one Captain
Cann, Bent, to his joy, found to be an old acquaintance.
He unfolded his dejected tale, and the sailor
at once offered his assistance in rescuing a fellow-countryman
from John Bull's grip. That evening
Bent stole away quietly from the barracks, boarded
the barque, and was stowed away safely below in
the dunnage-hole. He did not show his nose above
hatches for two days; the barque by that time
had left the harbour on her return voyage to Boston,
and the deserter was able to appear on deck, a free
man.</p>

<p>But not for long. Bent's misfortunes were only
beginning. When about three hundred miles off
the land a furious easterly gale began to blow, and
the old barkey sprang a leak. Hove-to in the
storm, all the crew could do was to stand to the
pumps. The huge Atlantic seas came thundering
on deck, and more than once washed the men away
from the pumps. For six days and six nights they
wallowed in the deep, all hands, sailors and passengers,
taking turns at the pumps, working for
their lives.</p>

<p>All those terrible days of storm and fear the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<i>Maria's</i> hands had nothing to eat but hard biscuits
soaked with salt water. There was no place to
cook and no means of cooking, for the galley with
all its contents had been washed overboard. While
the crew laboured at the pumps, the captain tried
to cheer them up and put a little life into their
weary bodies and despairing hearts by playing
lively airs on his concertina and singing sailors'
chanteys.</p>

<p>"One day," says Bent, "a German brig hove in
sight and spoke us. Seeing our signal of distress
she asked the name of our barque and the number
of the crew. We signalled our reply, and she
answered that she could not help us, there was too
much sea. Then she squared away and left us.
All this time we were labouring at the pumps to
keep the old barque afloat. Next day another brig,
a Boston vessel deep-loaded, from the West Indies,
hailed us and stood by, signalling to us to launch
our boats. This we did, after hard and dangerous
work, and managed to reach the brig's side, where
all the sixteen of us were hauled on board safely.
About two hours after we left our ship we saw her
go down."</p>

<p>To Bent's intense disappointment he found that
the brig that had rescued him was bound for the
wrong side of the Atlantic. She landed the shipwrecked
mariners at Glasgow. Bent was walking
about the streets one day, wondering however he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
was going to get a passage home, for he had no
money, when he was arrested as a deserter&mdash;recognised
by the description which had been posted in
every barrack-room and every police-station. He
was taken to the military barracks, and then sent
under guard to Ireland and down to Cork, where
he was tried by court-martial, and sentenced to
eighty-four days in prison. When he had served
his term he was shipped off to India with his regiment,
landing at Bombay, and for some time did
garrison duty at Poona.</p>

<p>The 57th spent two years in India, only just
recovering from the terrible throes of the Mutiny.
Then news came of a serious war with a wild native
race in a distant country called New Zealand, far
away down in the Southern Ocean, and the regiment
was ordered to hold itself in readiness to go route-marching
to Bombay, thence to sea. Marching
orders soon followed, and the headquarters of the
regiment sailed for Auckland; the company in
which Bent was a private (No. 8 Company) was
one of those left behind to look after the women and
children of the regiment. Orders for them also
quickly came, and they took the road for Bombay.</p>

<p>The journey from Poona to Bombay took four
days, or rather nights, for all the marching was
done by night. Part of the way was through a
dense jungle in which man-eating tigers swarmed.
The troops marched through this jungle by torchlight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
winding along a narrow track through the
densely-matted vegetation. The growling of the
tigers was heard all round at night, but the blazing
torches kept them away.</p>

<p>Embarked in a troopship at Bombay, Bent and
his fellow-soldiers sailed not unwillingly for a land
spoken of by report as a country which, though
wild and new, was a pleasanter place to live in
than scorching sun-baked India.</p>

<p>After a voyage of eighty-nine days, the troopship
anchored in Auckland Harbour, and her soldiers
spent their first week on New Zealand soil in the
old Albert Barracks, where the bright flower-gardens
and tree-groves of a beautiful park now
crown the hill that in those troubled days was
girt with a massive crenellated wall, and was alive
with all the martial turmoil of campaigning-time.
Then the new arrivals were sent down to Taranaki
by sea to join the headquarters of the 57th, and
went into new barrack life on Marsland Hill, New
Plymouth.</p>

<p>Kimble Bent's longing for a free independent
life became stronger than ever in this new country.
He would gladly have exchanged camp-life for even
the perilous occupation of a frontier settler, so
that he were free. The parade ground was a
purgatory, and the restraint of discipline and the
ramrod-and-pipeclay system of soldiering were
irksome beyond words. He was sick to death of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
being ordered about by sergeants and corporals.
Fighting would have been a relief, but there was
none yet. He endeavoured to get his discharge
from the regiment, but without success; and his
impatience of discipline led him into various more
or less serious conflicts with the regimental authorities.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>So opened Kimble Bent's life in the new land,
the land in which he was to roam the forests an
outlaw for more than a decade.</p>

<p>In those war-days of 1860-70 dense forests covered
the wide plains of this Taranaki province, where
now most of the dark old woods have been hewn
away, and have given place to the pastures and
homesteads of dairy farmers. It was a wild but
beautiful land. The coast curved out and round
in a great sweeping semicircle from Waitara in
the north to Wanganui in the south; the intervening
region of forest, hill, and plain was the
theatre of war. High and central, Taranaki's
great mountain-cone, which the <i>pakeha</i> calls Egmont,
swelled to a height of over 8,000 feet, its
base hidden in the forests, its snowy peak glittering
far above the broad soft swathes of clouds, the
sailor's landmark a hundred miles out at sea.
Remote from all other high mountains it soared
aloft&mdash;"lonely as God and white as a winter morn,"
as Joaquin Miller wrote of his beloved Mount Shasta.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
On all sides Taranaki&mdash;the holy mountain of the
Maoris&mdash;sloped evenly and gently to the plains,
and from its recesses sprang the head waters of
many a beautiful river. The mountain, huge yet
exquisitely symmetrical, was revered by the old-school
Taranaki Maori as the mighty symbol of
his nationality, and regarded as being in some
mystic fashion the source of his tribal <i>mana</i>.
Under the shadow of Taranaki began the Ten Years'
War; here the Hauhau fanaticism took its mad
rise in 1864. From Taranaki's foot set out the
Hauhau apostles, preaching a strange jumble of
Scriptural expressions and pagan Maori concepts,
promising their converts that no <i>pakeha</i> bullet
should harm them if they but repeated their magic
incantations; and brandishing before the ranks
of their devotees the dried and smoked heads of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
slain white soldiers. The relapse into barbarism
was more marked in Taranaki than anywhere else,
and even to this day the hatred of the white man
lingers there, amongst the remnants of the old
Hauhau stock. Te Whiti, the Prophet of Parihaka,
until his death in 1907, held his court under the
shadow of lofty Taranaki, and preached his old
mysticism fortified by the towering presence of
his mountain-god, cold and immutable, and all
unmindful of the <i>pakeha's</i> march through the
plains below.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>In March, 1864, the 57th were ordered from New
Plymouth to Manawapou (not far from the present
town of Hawera), near the Tangahoé River. The
fanatic Hauhau faith had just been born amongst
the Maoris, whose palisaded <i>pas</i> dotted the outskirts
of the great forests on the farther side of
the Tangahoé, and whose war-songs could sometimes
be heard from the white soldiers' camp. At
Manawapou the regiment went under canvas, and
now began the regular round of sentry-go and
outpost duty, and all the preparations for an
advance on the rebel positions.</p>

</div>

<p>Meantime there was fighting in the northern and
western parts of the Taranaki province, between
the 57th camp and New Plymouth. There was
the disastrous affair at Te Ahuahu, where Captain
Lloyd and several soldiers were killed; their heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
were cut off and smoke-dried by the Hauhau
savages, and were carried away to distant tribes
by Kereopa, Patara, and other rebel emissaries, the
Hauhau recruiting officers. Another momentous
affair which happened soon after the 57th took post
at Manawapou was the desperate assault on the
British redoubt at Sentry Hill (Te Morere). A large
force of Hauhau warriors, deluded by their prophet
Hepanaia into believing that his incantations
rendered them invulnerable to the white man's
bullets, rushed against the redoubt in open daylight
one morning, but were beaten off, leaving
some fifty of their number lying dead in front of
the fort. It was in this engagement that Titokowaru&mdash;who
was afterwards Kimble Bent's chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and master&mdash;lost one of his eyes through a bullet
wound.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Kimble Bent's final revolt against constituted
authority came one wet, cold day in the Manawapou
camp in April 1864. It was pouring with rain,
but a corporal, one who took a vindictive sort of
pleasure in asserting his authority over those
privates whom he happened to dislike, ordered
Bent to go out and cut some firewood in the bush.
Irritated by the manner in which the order was
given, the young "Down-Easter" was foolish
enough to argue with his enemy the corporal.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "this is no day to
send a man out cutting wood. The officers can
stay in their tents laughing at us fellows out
in the rain. We're treated like a set of blessed
dogs."</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't go, won't you?" sneered the
corporal, rejoicing at having irritated the soldier
into insubordination.</p>

<p>"No, I won't go," said Bent defiantly; "so
you can do what you like about it."</p>

<p>The corporal reported Bent to his immediate
superiors, and the soldier was arrested and lodged
in the guard-tent. Next morning he was brought
before a court-martial and tried for disobedience
of orders. Major Haszard was the president of the
court. With him sat Captain Clark, Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Brown, and Ensign Parker. Bent knew it was
useless to attempt a defence, for his offence was
an inexcusable breach of discipline. He was found
guilty, and the sentence of the court was that he
should receive fifty lashes, and serve two years in
gaol.</p>

<p>The triangles were then a familiar institution
in every military camp in the Waikato and in
Taranaki; for those were flogging days, when even
slight breaches of military rules brought down the
lash upon the soldier's back.</p>

<p>One of the regimental surgeons, Dr. Andrews,
examined Bent, as was the practice before flogging
was inflicted, and he reported that in his opinion
the young soldier was not constitutionally fit to
endure the fifty lashes ordered.</p>

<p>Soon after Bent had been taken to his tent under
guard, one of the officers of the court-martial came
in to see him. This was Captain Clark, a fine
jovial young Canadian-born soldier, who had
rather a liking for the unfortunate man from his
end of the world.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Bent," he said; "you'll only get
twenty-five&mdash;the sentence is reduced. And put
that in your mouth when you go to the triangles,"
and he threw down a sixpence. Then, when the
guard-tent corporal was not looking, the kindly officer
took a flask of rum from his breast-pocket, laid it on
the tent floor, and walked away to his quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>When Bent was called out for punishment, he
quickly drank off the rum, and put the sixpence
in his mouth. He knew the old soldier's recipe
for a "stiff upper lip" in the agony of flogging&mdash;"bite
on the bullet." The sixpence would serve
him as well. It would keep his teeth from biting
through his tongue in the throes of that horrible
punishment.</p>

<p>A bugle sounded the "Fall in." No. 8 Company
was paraded in review order on the drill ground to
"witness punishment." Bent was marched down
to the square; he was stripped to the waist and
tied to the triangles. The big drummer of the
Company stepped to the front; he was the flagellant.
Bent bit on his substitute for a bullet as
the cat swished through the air and fell like a red-hot
knife on his quivering back. Again and again
came the frightful cuts, criss-cross upon his back
and shoulders, till the tale of twenty-five was
complete. Then the prisoner was cast loose,
swearing in his pain and passion to have the drummer's
life. A blanket was thrown across his raw
and bleeding shoulders, and he was marched
back to the guard-tent, where the surgeon prescribed
for him in rough-and-ready fashion;
then to prison&mdash;he refused to go into the camp
hospital.</p>

<p>Bent served some months in Wellington Prison,
doing cook-house work, in expiation of his offence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
against military discipline. Then he was sent
back to his hated regiment. The shame of that
morning at the triangles, with his comrades paraded
to witness his disgrace and agony, was burned into
him for ever. He grew morose and desperate. At
last he resolved to desert to the enemy. He confided
his resolve to his tent-mates, and they, knowing
that other soldiers had deserted to the Maoris
and had not been killed, did not attempt to dissuade
him. "I can't be worse off with the Maoris
than I am here," he told them; "if they do tomahawk
me, it will end all my troubles. I don't very
much care."</p>

<p>So he bided his time for a favourable opportunity
to steal from the camp; and soon his chance
came. It was on June 12, 1865, that he broke
camp and fell in with the Hauhau scout on the
banks of the Tangahoé.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE CAMP OF THE HAUHAUS</p>

<p class="blockquote">In the Maori country&mdash;Arrival at a Hauhau <i>Pa</i>&mdash;Maori village
scenes&mdash;The ceremonies round the sacred flagstaff&mdash;"<i>Riré, riré,
hau!</i>"&mdash;The man with the tomahawk&mdash;A white slave&mdash;The painted
warriors of Keteonetea&mdash;The blazing oven.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">The</span> saturnine Hauhau spoke little to the white
man during that journey to the rebel camp. He
stalked silently on in front, his rifle over his
shoulder, turning quickly now and again to assure
himself that the soldier was still following him.
Presently they forded another stream, which Bent
afterwards came to know as the Ingahape, and
passed through a deserted settlement, with its
tumble-down dwellings of <i>raupo</i> reeds, and its old
potato-gardens. A few minutes later they came
in sight of their destination, the Ohangai <i>pa</i>. A
high stockade of tree-trunks sunk in the ground,
some of the upper ends hewn into sharp points,
others with round knobby tops that suggested
impaled human heads, surrounded a populous
village of thatched huts. Just beyond it was the
bush, stretching away as far as the eye could carry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
It was a secluded, pretty scene, that village with
its neat enclosure, its rows of snug <i>wharés</i> which
could be seen through the gateway and the openings
in the palisade, and its squares of maize and potato
cultivations, sheltered by the friendly belt of dark
green forest.</p>

<p>Some little, nearly naked children were playing
about on the open space in front of the palisades.
When they suddenly beheld a white man riding
along towards them, with a Maori walking by his
stirrup, they stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed,
and then rushed helter-skelter into the <i>pa</i>, calling
out at the top of their voices, "<i>He pakeha, he
pakeha!</i>"</p>

<p>What a commotion that cry of "<i>Pakeha</i>"
aroused in the slumbering <i>pa</i>! Men leaped from
the flax <i>whariki</i> (mats), where they had been drowsing
away the afternoon awaiting the opening of the
steam ovens, and poured out of the narrow gateway
armed with their guns and tomahawks. When
they saw that the European was a harmless, unarmed
individual, and that he was apparently the
prisoner of one of their own people, the clamour
died away, and they escorted the soldier and his
captor into the <i>pa</i>. Bent quickly perceived that
his companion was a man of some importance,
from the peremptory orders he issued and the
alacrity with which they were obeyed. The scout
was, in fact, the chief Tito te Hanataua, a <i>rangatira</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of high standing in the Ngati-Ruanui tribe, and one
of the Hauhaus' best fighting-leaders.</p>

<p>It was a wild scene that met the young soldier's
gaze when he entered the stockade, and his heart
sank before the savagely hostile gaze of a crowd
of armed, half-stripped warriors, the black-bearded
and shaggy-headed men of the bush, and their
scarcely less savage-looking women.</p>

<p>A strange ceremony began.</p>

<p>In the centre of the village square or <i>marae</i> stood
a rough-hewn pole or flagstaff, about fifteen feet
high, on which flew one or two coloured flags.
This was the <i>Niu</i>, the sacred staff which the Hauhau
prophet Te Ua had commanded his followers to
erect as a pole of worship in each of their villages.
[The <i>Niu</i> was in more ancient times the name of a
peculiar ceremony of divination often resorted to
by the <i>tohungas</i> or priests; it is perhaps worth
noting, too, that in the Islands of Polynesia, the
traditional Maori Hawaiki, it is the general name
for the coco-nut-tree.] All the inhabitants of the
village&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;formed up,
and began to march round and round the <i>Niu</i>,
with a priest in their midst, rushing frantically to
and fro, and brandishing a Maori weapon as he
yelled a ferocious-sounding chant. The people,
too, lifted up their voices as they marched, and,
after listening a while, Bent found to his astonishment
that part of what they were chanting in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
singular wild cadence were these words in "pidgin"
English: "Big river, long river, big mountain,
long mountain, bush, big bush, long bush," and
so on, ending with a loudly chanted cry, "<i>Riré,
riré, hau!</i>" This meaningless gibberish formed
part of the incantations solemnly taught to the
Hauhaus by Te Ua, who professed to have the
"gift of tongues" of which the <i>pakeha's</i> New
Testament spoke; his disciples fondly believed that
they were endowed by their prophet's "angel"
with wonderful linguistic powers.</p>

<p>The singular march suddenly ceased, at an order
from the shawl-kilted <i>tohunga</i> in the centre, and
then the people filed into the village meeting-house,
a large <i>raupo</i>-reed-built structure, taking
Bent with them. He was motioned to a seat
beside a Maori, whose name, he afterwards found,
was Hori Kerei (George Grey), and who could
speak English fairly well.</p>

<p>Sitting opposite Bent was a white-bearded old
fighting-man, a dour-faced savage, his brown face
deeply scored with the marks of blue-black tattoo;
his sole attire was a blanket; in his right hand,
and partly concealed by the blanket, he held a
tomahawk. His hand twitched now and then, as
if he were about to flash out the tomahawk and
use it on the <i>pakeha</i>, from whose face he never
withdrew his fierce old eyes. He was the chief,
Te Rangi-tutaki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>A long talk began. Hori Kerei interpreted. The
Maoris asked Bent why he had come to them, why
had he run away from his own people. The deserter
frankly told them that he was tired of
being a soldier, that he had been ill-treated
and imprisoned, and that he came to them for
protection.</p>

<p>"<i>Pakeha</i>," said Kerei, "they want to know if
you will ever leave the Maori and go back to the
soldiers."</p>

<p>"No," said Bent; "tell them I'll never run
away from the Hauhaus. I want to live with them
always; I don't ever want to see a white man
again!"</p>

<p>"<i>Kapai!</i>" said Grey good-humouredly. "That
the talk! All right, I tell them true."</p>

<p>When Kerei had interpreted the white man's
reply, the old man with the tomahawk leaned over
and said, very earnestly, tapping the blade of the
weapon with his left hand as he spoke:</p>

<p>"<i>Whakarongo mai!</i> Listen, <i>pakeha</i>! You see
this <i>patiti</i> in my hand? Yes. If you had not at
once replied that you would never return to the
white soldiers I would have killed you. I would
have sunk this into your skull!"</p>

<p>After this brief speech, delivered with a fierceness
of mien and glitter of eye that made the
refugee tremble in spite of his efforts to appear
calm, the old barbarian shook hands with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Tito te Hanataua&mdash;the man who had
brought the soldier to the <i>pa</i>&mdash;rose and said:</p>

<p>"O my tribe, listen to me! Take good care of
the <i>pakeha</i>, and harm him not, because our prophet
has told us that if any white men come to us as
this man has done, and leave their own tribe for
ours, we must not injure them, but must keep them
with us and protect them."</p>

<p>Tito's word assured Bent's safety, and the tone
of the people changed to one of friendliness; many
of them shook hands with the lonely white man.
The women cooked some pork and potatoes for
him in an earth-oven, and he was given to eat,
and received into the tribe. Henceforth he was
as a Maori.</p>

<p>Now began for the runaway an even harder life
than that which he had endured in the army. He
found that he was virtually a slave amongst the
Maoris. He had had fond imaginings of the easy
time he would enjoy in the heart of Maoridom, but
to quote from his own lips, "they made me work
like a blessed dog." Soon after his arrival in the
<i>pa</i> a party of men was sent off to Taiporohenui&mdash;a
celebrated old village and meeting-place near
the present town of Hawera&mdash;and he was ordered
to go with them, and was set to work felling bush,
clearing and digging, gathering firewood, and
hauling water for the camp. Tito was his master&mdash;not
only his master, but in hard fact his owner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
with power of life and death over him. Bent
divined the Maori nature too well to refuse "fatigue
duty," as he had done in the Manawapou camp.
There would have been no court-martial in Taiporohenui&mdash;just
a crack on the head with a tomahawk.
So he bent his back to the burdens with
what cheerfulness he might, and was thankful for
the good things Tito provided, though they took
no more elaborate form than a blanket and a flax
mat for a bed, and two square meals a day of pork
and potatoes.</p>

<p>Tito was, says Bent, a man of about forty-five
years of age, a stern, but not unkindly owner, with
a pretty young wife of seventeen or eighteen,
whose big, dark eyes were often turned with an
expression of pity on the unfortunate renegade
<i>pakeha</i>.</p>

<p>The people watched the white man closely,
thinking no doubt that as he was being worked so
hard he might be tempted to run away if he got
the chance. And whenever he went out of doors
the old man who had sat opposite him in the meeting-house
on the day of his first arrival followed
him about, never speaking a word, with his tomahawk
in his hand.</p>

<p>The news that a white soldier had run away to
the Hauhaus soon spread amongst the Ngati-Ruanui.
One day a messenger from the large
village of Keteonetea came to Taiporohenui and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
announced that he had been sent to fetch the
strange <i>pakeha</i> to that settlement.</p>

<p>"What do they want with me?" asked Bent,
when Tito told him that the envoy was waiting
for him.</p>

<p>"They want to see the colour of your skin,"
replied Tito.</p>

<p>Bent, in alarm, begged Tito not to send him to
Keteonetea, for he greatly feared that he would
be killed.</p>

<p>Tito reassured his white man, telling him that
the Keteonetea people were his relatives, and that
he was not to be alarmed at their demeanour,
because they would not harm him.</p>

<p>The messenger and his white charge tramped
away through the bush to the village, a lonely
little spot hemmed in by the dense forests&mdash;long
since hewn away and replaced by grassy fields and
dairy farms. A palisade surrounded the <i>kainga</i>;
within were clusters of large well-built reed <i>wharés</i>,
and the inevitable <i>Niu</i> pole stood in the middle
of the <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>Bent found a large number of Maoris, about
three hundred, assembled on the <i>marae</i>, the village
parade ground. The scene still lives vividly in his
memory&mdash;an even wilder, more savage spectacle
than that of his first day at Tito's <i>pa</i>. The men's
faces were painted red, in token of war&mdash;red smudges
of ochre on their cheeks and red lines drawn across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
their brows; they wore feathers in their hair,
their only clothes were flax mats. The lone <i>pakeha</i>
might well have imagined himself back in the days
of ancient Maoridom, before missionaries or traders
had changed the barbaric simplicity of the aboriginal
life. The only modern note was the firearms of the
warriors; all the men carried guns (most of them
double-barrelled shot-guns, and a few rifles and
carbines), and wore tomahawks stuck in their
broad-plaited flax belts. Most of the women were
as primitive in their garb as the men; their clothing
consisted chiefly of flaxen cloaks; a few wore
shawls and blankets.</p>

<p>"The people looked at me very fiercely as I
came into the <i>marae</i>," says Bent, "and I felt my
heart sinking low, in spite of Tito's assurance."
They put him into a <i>raupo</i> hut by himself, and
fastened the door&mdash;a proceeding that did not at all
tend to elevate his spirits.</p>

<p>The ex-soldier was left to himself in the dark
<i>wharé</i> for quite a couple of hours. He could hear
the people gathered on the village square discussing
him excitedly; one orator after another declaiming
with frantic energy. At length a Maori unfastened
the door of the <i>wharé</i>, and, taking Bent by the
hand, led him out on to the <i>marae</i>. The native
could speak English; Bent afterwards found that
he had been an old whaler, and had lived amongst
white people for many years; his name was Kere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
(Kelly). He told the <i>pakeha</i>, with some show of
kindness, that he must not be frightened, that no
one would harm him, but he must go to the sacred
<i>Niu</i> and promise that he would never return to
the <i>pakehas</i>.</p>

<p>The first thing that met Bent's eyes on stepping
out through the low doorway of the <i>wharé</i> was a
great fire blazing in the centre of the <i>marae</i>, surrounded
by a ring of short stakes. Accustomed as
he was by this time to sights of terror, this struck
a fresh note of alarm.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he said to himself, "are they
going to burn me alive?"</p>

<p>"Friend," he said to Kere, "tell me, what's
that fire for?"</p>

<p>The Maori explained that it was an <i>ahi tapu</i>, a
sacred fire, used in the Hauhau war-rites.</p>

<p>Bent was very doubtful. "I'm afraid," said he to
his companion, "that it's for me! Are they going to
throw me into it? I've heard they do such things."</p>

<p>"No, no, <i>pakeha</i>! It's all right. You'll be
safe. But remember, do as the <i>tohunga</i> tells you,
and promise him you'll never go back to the <i>pakeha</i>
soldiers, or you'll die!"</p>

<p>The Maori led the white man up to the foot of
the <i>Niu</i> pole, a tall ricker, with rough crosstrees
and with flag halliards of flax rope. Bent was
told to sit down at the foot of the pole. The
people all gathered around in a ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>A tall old warrior stood in the middle of the ring,
facing Bent&mdash;the prophet of the <i>Niu</i>. He was
naked from the waist up; his face was completely
covered with tattooing. He was a <i>tohunga</i>, or
priest, Bent afterwards discovered; by name
Tu-ahi-pa, or Tautahi-ariki, a man held in much
awe by the people as a worker of <i>makutu</i> (witchcraft).</p>

<p>For a long time the old wizard closely eyed the
pale-faced stranger before him. Then he said,
through the interpreter, Kere:</p>

<p>"You behold this ring of people, the people of
Keteonetea?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bent.</p>

<p>"I ask you this, will you return to your people
or remain with us?"</p>

<p>"I will never return to the <i>pakehas</i>," Bent replied;
"I want to live with the Maoris and to
make them my people."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the Hauhau priest. "Now,
turn your eyes upon yon fire, burning there upon
the <i>marae</i>. Well, if you had not promised to become
a Maori and live with us, the tribe would
have thrown you into that blazing oven. It is
well that you have spoken as you have."</p>

<p>This, to Bent's great relief, ended the ordeal.
The Hauhaus, at a cry from the priest, began their
mad march round the <i>Niu</i>&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;chanting as they went their savage psalms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
rolling their eyes and lifting their arms high in
the air as every now and again they cried their
wild refrain, "<i>Riré, riré, hau!</i>"&mdash;the last word
literally barked out from the hundreds of throats.</p>

<p>When the Hauhau ceremony was at an end, a
young woman who had joined in the march round
the <i>Niu</i> came to Bent, took him away to a hut and
gave him a meal of pork and potatoes, and then
led him to her father's house. The father was the
principal chief of the <i>kainga</i>, and, as it turned out,
cousin to Bent's <i>rangatira</i> Tito.</p>

<p>Here the white man spent the night, the chief's
daughter lying across the entrance just inside the
doorway, for fear&mdash;as the chief told him&mdash;that some
young desperado might take it into his head to
earn a little notoriety by tomahawking the pale-face.
Outside, the Maoris were gathered on the <i>marae</i>,
by the light of great fires, the chiefs making speeches
and <i>taki</i>-ing up and down in excited fashion,
weapon in hand; now and again the fanatic crowd
would burst into a loud Hauhau chant that echoed
long amidst the black encircling forest. So the
wild <i>korero</i> went on, far into the night.</p>

<p class="center">IN THE OTAPAWA STOCKADE</p>

<p class="blockquote">The return from Keteonetea&mdash;The hill-fort at Otapawa&mdash;A <i>korero</i>
with the Hauhaus&mdash;Bent's one-eyed wife&mdash;"The wooing o' 't"&mdash;Bent
is christened "Ringiringi."</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Morning</span> came at last, but the solitary white man
in this nest of savages had hardly closed his eyes.
More than once he fancied some one was trying the
low door of the <i>wharé</i>, and he looked round the
dimly-lighted hut&mdash;a small fire was kept burning
in the centre of the floor&mdash;in search of a weapon,
but found none. Bent lay there, listening intently,
and longing with an inexpressibly bitter longing for
the old camp-life, hard though it was, and for the
sound of a white comrade's voice. It had not
always been "pack-drill and C.B." in his army life,
in spite of the tyrant sergeants. But now it was
the bush and the <i>wharé</i> for the rest of his days&mdash;or,
in other words, for just so long a period as he
might be able to save his head from the tomahawk.</p>

<p>Daybreak&mdash;and no sooner was it light than the
Hauhaus began to gather round the <i>pakeha's</i> hut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
while the women were lighting the <i>hangis</i>&mdash;the
earth steam-ovens&mdash;for the first meal of the day.
"Come out to us!" they yelled; "come out,
<i>pakeha</i>!" They ran to and fro in front of the
<i>wharé</i>, and raised barking cries that sounded fearfully
menacing to the <i>pakeha</i> sitting on his low
mat-bed, and feeling not in the least disposed to
respond to the invitation to come outside and be
killed.</p>

<p>But the old chief speedily ended the uproar by
opening the sliding door and shouting angrily:</p>

<p>"<i>Haere atu! Haere atu!</i>" an imperative phrase
that the deserter had already learned to recognise
as one that could be exactly translated "Clear
out!"</p>

<p>Thereafter there was comparative peace. The
white man was under the protection of the chief,
and was allowed to wander round the village pretty
much as he chose; but he was warned not to go
far, or some warrior might take a fancy to his head.</p>

<p>Four or five days passed without incident, and
then a horse was brought up for Bent, and he
returned to Tito's <i>kainga</i>, escorted by the chief's
daughter and ten armed men, all mounted. Tito
seemed relieved to have his <i>pakeha</i> back again in
safety, and after feasting the Maori guard on the
best the village women could lay on the dinner-mats,
he sent them back to Keteonetea loaded with
new clothes and baskets of <i>kumara</i> (sweet potato)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and <i>taro</i>&mdash;another tropic root-food brought from
Polynesia by the ancestors of the Maori, but now
no longer grown by the Taranaki people.</p>

<p>Soon Bent was on the tramp again. His chief,
Tito, set off one morning, taking his white man
with him, for a fortified village called Otapawa,
where the Hauhaus were preparing to offer a strong
resistance to the British troops. Otapawa was
about four miles away by a narrow and winding
forest track. A small river, the Mangemange,
had to be forded on the way, and here Bent had
a taste of some of the minor adventures of the
bush. Bent being a rather small man and Tito a
big, powerful fellow, the Maori good-naturedly took
his <i>pakeha</i> on his back to <i>pikau</i> him across the
stream. Bent was rather heavier than Tito had
imagined, and after balancing to and fro precariously
on a slippery place in the deepest part of the ford,
the Maori's feet suddenly went from under him,
and he and his protégé were capsized in the middle
of the creek. Tito, however, kept a tight grip of
the white man, and, though the stream was running
swiftly, they managed to struggle out to the opposite
bank in safety, and after drying their clothes as
well as they could continued their bush journey.</p>

<p>About midday the Hauhau chief and his companion
emerged from the solitudes of the forest
to find themselves in the Otapawa clearing. A
hill about three hundred feet high rose like an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
island from the great <i>rimu</i> and <i>rata</i> woods that
compassed it on every side; at the back ran the
Tangahoé River. At the foot of the hill there was
some cultivation; a steep winding path led to the
top; here were a ditch and a bristling double
stockade of tall tree-trunks set solidly in the
ground, connected by cross-rails lashed with forest
vines; within was the Hauhau village. The only
access to the interior of the stockade was through
a low and narrow gateway, painted red.</p>

<p>A shawl-clad figure with a gun rose from a
squatting position just outside the <i>pa</i> gate as the
two travellers walked out from the shade of the
forest and began the ascent of the mound. A loud
cry of astonishment and warning brought out the
villagers, one after the other, bobbing their heads
as they ran through the gateway. Then the shout
was raised, as they recognised Bent's companion:</p>

<p>"<i>Aue!</i> Here comes Tito with a <i>pakeha</i>! A
<i>pakeha</i>!"</p>

<p>Waving shawls and blankets and weapons, the
people cried their greetings to the chief, and the
white man and his protector walked in between
two lines of wondering men and women and children,
who pressed in close behind the new-comers
as they passed into the palisaded <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>A long, low-eaved, thatched house stood near the
middle of the <i>pa</i>, somewhat apart from the smaller
<i>wharés</i>. Into this building Tito and Bent were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
taken, and finely woven flax mats, patterned in
black and white, were spread out for them. Tito
rose and addressed the crowd. He explained, with
a good deal of pride, as Bent imagined, how he had
become possessed of a live white man&mdash;a somewhat
unusual acquisition amongst the Maoris in that
unrestful period, for the impatient Hauhau was, as
a rule, too fond of trying his new tomahawk on a
<i>pakeha</i> skull to keep a prisoner long. The <i>korero</i>
over, food was brought in in freshly plaited baskets
of green flax&mdash;boiled pork, dried shark (a present
from a seaside tribe), boiled <i>taro</i> and <i>kumara</i>&mdash;quite
a bountiful meal for a war-time bush camp.</p>

<p>Up to this time the deserter's adventures had
been, if not exactly tragic, at least of a severely
unpleasant turn. Now, however, they took a
humorous twist&mdash;humorous from an onlooker's
view, though to the white man himself it seemed
rather the final pannikinful in the bucket of his
misfortunes.</p>

<p>A woman was brought into the <i>wharé</i>. She
walked over and seated herself on the flax <i>whariki</i>
by Bent's side.</p>

<p>The white man turned and looked at her in some
surprise. Her vision still haunts the memory of
the old adventurer as that of a particularly ugly
woman. She was not old, probably not above
twenty-five, but she was blind in one eye, her lips
were of negroid thickness&mdash;such "blubber" lips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
as seen here and there among Maori tribes tell
their tale of an ancient Melanesian strain in the
blood of the Polynesian immigrants. She was
tattooed on the chin, and there was a deeply
chiselled blue line on the inner cuticle of her lower
lip. Her hair hung round her face in a tangled
mop. "Well," said Bent to himself, "she is no
beauty."</p>

<p>The woman spoke some words of greeting to
Bent, but he steadily gazed on the floor and said
nothing.</p>

<p>Then a Maori sitting near by, who could speak
a little English, said, "This woman wants to marry
you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" exclaimed Bent. "What for?
I don't want to get married."</p>

<p>An old man, whose name was Peneta, and who
was draped from shoulder to ankles in a red blanket,
walked up to the white man and, halting in front
of him, pointed to the one-eyed woman.</p>

<p>"<i>Pakeha</i>," he said, with a quiet grimness in his
tone, "this is my niece, Te Rawanga. You must
marry her (<i>me moe korua</i>). If you refuse, you
will die! That is all."</p>

<p>This was translated to Bent.</p>

<p>Here was a dilemma, indeed! Bent had nothing
to say. He looked at the woman by his side, and
she smiled at him as coquettishly as her one good
eye allowed. He looked, and the more he looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the less he liked her. Then he glanced at the dour
old uncle, and cast his helpless eyes around the
crowded meeting-house. The men were glum and
scowling; one or two of the young girls seemed
to perceive the humour of the situation, for they
giggled, and then hid their faces in their shawls.</p>

<p>Bent eyed his prospective uncle-in-law again.
The old man was impatient. He said again, "Take
my niece as your wife."</p>

<p>"<i>Ae</i>," assented the white man, who could see
no hope of escape. "I'll take her."</p>

<p>So the young soldier was mated, to the satisfaction
of every one but himself. "She wasn't my
fancy, to put it mildly," he says. "But I suppose
it was her last chance, and the old man would have
tomahawked me if I hadn't taken her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bent's wedding-furnishings, which she
bundled a little later, with determined air, into the
corner of the communal house assigned to the white
man, were spartan and primitive in the extreme.</p>

<p>They consisted solely of a large plaited <i>whariki</i>
(sleeping-mat) and a wooden pillow, which, to the
white man, seemed alarmingly like some weapon
of chastisement.</p>

<p>Matrimony amongst the Hauhaus was simplicity
itself.</p>

<p>Bent, now fully received into the tribe, had a
Maori name given to him. It was "Ringiringi," a
name he bore for two or three years, until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
war-chief Titokowaru rechristened him "Tu-nui-a-moa."</p>

<p>The origin of this name "Ringiringi" may be
explained, as an example of the way in which the
Maoris so frequently acquire new names often from
very trivial incidents. It was a contraction of
"Te Wai-ringiringi," which was one of Tito te
Hanataua's nicknames, bestowed upon the chief
about two years previously. A party of Ngati-Maniapoto
Maoris from the King Country were at
that time on a visit to Taiporohenui, where a large
war-council of the rebel tribes was held. Tito te
Hanataua was one of the Taranaki orators, and as
he <i>taki</i>'d up and down, spear in hand, in the usual
energetic manner of the Maori speech-maker, he
spoke so rapidly and fluently that the Kingites
dubbed him "Te Wai-ringiringi," meaning "The
Pouring Water," because his words poured from
his lips like water. Tito was rather proud of this
nickname, and his bestowal of it upon Bent was in
a sense a mark of favour.</p>

<p>Bent at this time was a thin, rather weak-looking
man, and his slimness was made the subject of a
<i>haka</i> chorus amongst the people, a little song for
which his one-eyed wife was responsible. These
were the words:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="center">TE UA, PRIEST AND PROPHET</p>

<p class="blockquote">Te Ua and his gods&mdash;The <i>Pai mariré</i> faith&mdash;"Charming" the
British bullets&mdash;Bent's interview with the prophet&mdash;His life
<i>tapu</i>'d&mdash;Preparing for battle&mdash;Life in the forest <i>pa</i>.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">About</span> this time Kimble Bent became acquainted
with a man whose name has passed into New
Zealand history. This was Te Ua Haumene, the
founder and high-priest and prophet of the Hauhau
religion, or, more correctly speaking, fanaticism.
Te Ua came riding into the Otapawa village one
day with a bodyguard of armed men. Bent describes
him as a stoutly built man of between forty
and fifty, attired in European clothing, and carrying
a carved <i>taiaha</i>&mdash;a chief's halbert or broadsword
of hardwood, flattened at one end in a blunt
blade, and sharpened at the other into a tongue-shaped
point, and decorated with tufts of red <i>kaka</i>
feathers; in a plaited flax belt round his waist was
thrust a greenstone <i>mere</i>.</p>

<p>Te Ua was the man who taught the Taranaki
rebels the <i>karakia</i>, or incantations&mdash;some of them a
curious medley of Maori and English&mdash;which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
chanted in their wild marches round the sacred
<i>Niu</i> in their village squares. These incantations
and chants he professed to have heard from supernatural
visitants, the spirits who came on the four
winds, and from the angel Gabriel, who spoke in
his ear as he lay asleep in his <i>raupo</i> hut and bade
him go abroad and spread a new religion, which
should band together the tribes of the Maori nation.
Many strange tales Bent had heard about the
prophet and his wondrous <i>mana</i>. Te Ua had
succeeded in imbuing his fanatic disciples with an
unquestioning Moslem-like faith in the potency of
the Hauhau cult and its accompanying charms and
magic formulæ. He was the Mahomet of the
Taranaki people, and exercised an influence over
the bush-fighters of Ngati-Ruanui and allied tribes
almost as great as that which Te Kooti, the Chatham
Islands escapee, commanded a few years later
amongst the warriors of the East Coast.</p>

<p>The absolute faith the Hauhaus reposed in Te
Ua's precepts and his pretences to supernatural
power has parallels in the records of the Mahdi's
wars in the Soudan, and in other campaigns waged
under the banner of Islam, and more recently still
in the Zulu rebellion in Natal. He assured his
followers that when they went into battle the
bullets of the white soldiers would be turned aside
in their flight if they but raised their right hands as
if warding the ball off, at the same time repeating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the words "<i>Hapa! Pai mariré!</i>" ("Pass over me!
Righteousness and peace!") The expression "<i>Pai
mariré</i>" was adopted as one of the designations of
the Hauhau religion; and the sign of the upraised
hand became the outward sign and symbol of the
warrior faith. To-day, should you visit the large
European-built house of the late Te Whiti, the Prophet
of the Mountain, at Parihaka, you will see a
picture of Te Ua on the wall of the speech-hall, his
right hand raised to his shoulder, palm outwards,
as if in the act of invoking his gods to turn the
<i>pakeha</i> bullets aside&mdash;"<i>Hapa! Pai mariré!</i>"
And many a deluded Hauhau fell to the rifles of the
white men before the Maori confidence in the efficacy
of the charm was shaken. But Te Ua had a
very good explanation to offer for any casualties&mdash;that
if the <i>pakeha</i> bullet refused to be waved aside
and insisted on entering the body of a "righteous and
peaceful" son of the faith, it was because the
stricken man had lost faith in the <i>karakia</i>&mdash;the
ritual&mdash;and, very properly, suffered for his unbelief.</p>

<p>A sublimely simple explanation, and one that
was perfectly satisfactory to the prophet and
every one concerned, except perhaps the Hauhau
who had happened to stop the bullet.</p>

<p>Even when the glacis of the Sentry Hill redoubt
was strewn with the dead bodies of Hepanaia and
fifty of his red-painted braves, the best manhood
of Ngati-Ruanui and Nga-Ruahiné&mdash;who fell in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
mad attack upon the walled fort in open daylight
chanting their "<i>Hapa! Pai mariré! Hau!</i>"&mdash;the
faith in Te Ua and his charms was but little
abated. And, unlike the Moslem warrior, who
fought to the death in the certain hope of a speedy
translation to Paradise, the Maori fanatic expected
no heavenly reward for his faith and his death-despising
ferocity. No <i>houris</i> with welcoming
arms; no eternity of fleshly bliss. No, it was just
utter blind bravery, a sheer trust in a mad creed
of Death-to-the-Whites and Maori Land for the
Maori Race.</p>

<p>So the visit of the high-priest of Hauhauism was
a great event in the bush <i>pa</i>. The prophet was
received with a <i>powhiri</i>, or chant and dance of
welcome, by the people of the village; then the
<i>tangi</i> and the doleful hum of weeping for the dead.
The <i>tangi</i> over, the prophet addressed his disciples
in the meeting-house; and hearing that there
was a white runaway soldier in the <i>pa</i>, he sent
for Bent.</p>

<p>It was a curious interview. The white man no
longer appeared in the soldier's uniform, which he
had worn for some time after deserting, but had
taken to the garb of the savage. He was bare-headed
and bare-footed. His sole garments were a
shirt made of pieces of blanket and a flax mat tied
round his waist. He entered the crowded council-house
and stood before the prophet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>E noho ki raro</i>" ("Sit down"), said Te Ua,
pointing to the floor-mat in front of him.</p>

<p>By the prophet's side was a flax basket containing
some potatoes and pork, with which he had
been breaking his fast after his journey. This
food being appropriated to his use was, of course,
<i>tapu</i> in the eyes of the assemblage. Te Ua took
a potato from the basket, broke it into two pieces,
and gave one piece to Bent and told him to eat
it; the other half he ate himself.</p>

<p>"Now," said the prophet, "you are <i>tapu</i>&mdash;your
life is safe; no man may harm you now that you
have eaten of my sacred food. Men of Tangahoé!
This <i>pakeha</i> is my <i>pakeha</i>; and if any other white
men should come to us as this man has done, fleeing
from their people and forsaking the <i>pakeha</i> camps
for our <i>pas</i>, you must protect them, for the gods
have sent them to us."</p>

<p>"You are a Maori now," added Te Ua to Bent,
"and you must have a woman to cook your food
for you."</p>

<p>Bent, in his imperfect Maori, informed the
prophet that he had already been supplied with a
wife by the Maoris, but, like a prudent man, made
no comment on her imperfections.</p>

<p>"That's all right then," said the prophet. And
he gave Bent a large cloak of dressed flax, called a
<i>tatara</i>. "Wear this," he said; "it is a <i>tapu</i> garment
and sacred to you; no other man may wear it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>During the next few days, before Te Ua returned
to his home at Opunake, on the coast, Bent had
further interviews with the prophet, who treated
him with kindness, and gave him what was to the
runaway a very welcome present&mdash;some <i>pakeha</i>
tobacco. Though something of a madman, like
most Maori prophets, Te Ua was of more benevolent
spirit than his acolytes, Kereopa and Patara, and
their kin, who had been sent to preach the gospel
of <i>Pai mariré</i> to the outer tribes. Had Kereopa,
for instance, come to Otapawa, Bent would, in all
probability, have fallen under the tomahawk as
a sacrifice for the savage ritual of the <i>Niu</i>, and
his head would have been smoke-dried and carried
over forest-trails from distant tribe to tribe, or
stuck up like a scarecrow on a palisade-pole.</p>

<p>Bent learnt a good deal of the personal history
of the prophet, and of his peculiar delusions. Te
Ua had fought the white soldiers at Nukumaru
about a year before this, when a force of Hauhaus
made a desperate attack on the camp of two thousand
British troops, under General Cameron, and
killed and wounded nearly fifty soldiers before they
were driven off with the loss of about thirty killed.</p>

<p>The outward and visible sign or incarnation
(<i>aria</i>) of Te Ua's deity was a <i>ruru</i>, or owl. This bird
is sacred amongst Taranaki Natives; they will
not kill or harm one; they say it is an <i>atua</i>, a god,
and has a hundred eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>An incident which Bent relates as occurring in
another bush settlement where he and Te Ua both
happened to be staying is illustrative of the prophet's
peculiar respect for his owl-god. Just at dusk,
when the evening meal was over, and the night
creatures began their roamings, an owl flew softly
from the trees and settled above the window of the
house in which Te Ua was sitting. "Ha!" said
the prophet, when he saw it; "there is my <i>atua</i>."
He recited an incantation, calling the <i>ruru</i> by name,
and when the <i>karakia</i> was ended the bird as noiselessly
flew back to the forest. Te Ua said nothing
more till the next morning, when he announced
that he would leave the place at once, because his
owl-god had appeared to him as a warning to return
to his home.</p>

<p>Soon after the wandering prophet rode out of
Otapawa, word reached the <i>pa</i> by a spy who had
been in the British camp that the troops under
General Chute were preparing for an advance
against the Hauhaus, and that it was probable the
hill stronghold, being so close to the white men's
base of operations, would shortly be attacked.</p>

<p>All was excitement in the <i>pa</i> when this became
known. The palisading of the <i>pa</i> was strengthened
with stout timbers from the forest; trenches and
rifle-pits were dug within the walls. The natives
worked away like mad, and Bent with them. He
had caught the fever of the moment, and in all but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
skin was a Maori. He was not at all happy, however,
at the news that his old regiment, the 57th,
was expected to march on Otapawa, and he heartily
wished himself far away from these scenes of
constant commotion and terror. But for the
present he was safer with the Hauhaus than with
the men of his own colour and tongue.</p>

<p>Day after day passed, and the Maoris lay behind
their strong stockade waiting for the attack. The
underground food-stores were well supplied; water
was carried in in <i>taha</i>, or calabashes, made by scooping
out the soft inside of the <i>hué</i> gourd; bullets
were cast and cartridges were made. Then, as no
troops appeared, and the scouts who kept constant
watch on the forest outskirts reported that there
was no sign of immediate action on the part of the
enemy, the tension of garrison life relaxed, and
the ordinary avocations of the <i>kainga</i> were resumed.</p>

<p>In a clearing hewn and burnt from the heart of
the woods were the cultivation grounds. Here all
the able-bodied men of the fort were set to work,
turning up the rich black soil and planting potatoes,
<i>kumara</i>, and <i>taro</i>. Planting over, the lengthening
days were spent in hunting wild pigs, and in gathering
wild honey, which was plentiful in hollow trees
in the forests; or in strolling, pipe in mouth, about
the <i>pa</i>; playing draughts (<i>kaimu</i>) on the <i>marae</i> in
Maori fashion; singing songs and narrating old
stories and legends. Night and morning there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
long Hauhau prayers, led by the priest of the <i>pa</i>,
old Tukino, who was one of Te Ua's apostles.</p>

<p>Life in this bush-fort presented to the lonely
<i>pakeha</i> a picture of barbaric simplicity. Few of the
people had European clothing; the men's working
garb was just a rough flax mat hanging from the
waist to the knees. They lived on the wild foods of
the forest until their crops were ready for digging;
snared <i>kaka</i> (parrots) and the sweet-tongued <i>korimako</i>,
or bell-birds; <i>tui</i>, or parson-birds, and the
swarming wood-pigeons, and shot or speared the
pigs that abounded in the dense woods. They
lived to a large extent, too, on <i>aruhe</i>, or fern-root,
which they dug up in the open patches of fern-land;
and in the bush they gathered the berries
of the <i>hinau</i>-tree, steeped them in water to rid
them of their astringency, dried them in the sun,
and then pounded them into cakes, which made a
sustaining if not very palatable food. Another
food-staple was <i>kaanga-pirau</i>, or maize steeped in
water until if was quite decayed. "The smell of
this Indian corn," says Bent, with an emphasis
begotten of unpleasant memories, "was enough to
kill a dog. Nevertheless, I had to eat it, and in
time I got used to it."</p>

<p>"I had at this time," continues the deserter,
recounting his wild days in Otapawa, "no boots,
no trousers, no shirt&mdash;just Maori flax mats to cover
me, and a mat and blanket for my bed. I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
managed to procure some needles and thread,
together with paper and pencil (I kept up a sort
of diary now and then), and one or two other little
things which I kept in a kit, thinking that, though
I had nothing to sew with the needles and thread,
and very little to do with the other belongings, they
might come in useful before very long. One of
my greatest troubles was the want of salt; as for
bread, I had not tasted any for many months."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> was on the forest. The beautiful midsummer
of Maori Land, with its soft airs and brilliant
sunshine, its blaze of crimson blossom on the
grand old <i>rata</i>-trees, and its showering of scented,
white, peach-like flowers on the thickets of ribbon-wood.
Birds flooded the outskirts of the bush
with song; the early morning chantings and
pipings and chimings of the <i>tui</i> and the <i>korimako</i>
made a feast of melody to which the brown forest
men were in no way deaf, for they delighted as
much as any <i>pakeha</i> in the sights and sounds of the
free, wild places, and the call of the creatures of the
bush. "<i>Te Waha-o-Tané</i>," literally "The Voice
of the Tree-God"&mdash;the Song of Nature&mdash;they called
these morning concerts of the birds; it was their
poetic expression in the classic tongue of old Polynesia
for the sounds that betokened the daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
awakening to light and life of the deep and solemn
forests of Tane-Mahuta. Pigeons, <i>ku-ku</i>-ing to
each other, with blue necks and white breasts
gleaming in the sun, went sweeping across the
clearing on softly winnowing wings, and flapped
from tree to tree and shrub to shrub in search of
the tenderest leaves, for it was not yet the season
of the choicest bush fruits, the big blue <i>tawa</i> berry,
the sweet yellow <i>koroi</i>, and the aromatic <i>miro</i>.</p>

<p>Life went easily in the <i>pa</i> when the early harvesting
was over. There was little to do but eat and
sleep and lie about in the sun, or join in the daily
prayers and the procession round the <i>Niu</i> pole,
where the brightly coloured war-flags hung.<a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a>
<a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There
was abundance of food in the camp&mdash;potatoes,
maize, potted birds, pork, and dried fish sent as
presents from the coast tribes. Early morning, and
again in the warm, golden evenings, long, straight
columns of pale blue smoke arose from the cooking-ovens
of the village, and mingled with the thin
vapours that crept about the tree-tops; then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
little clouds of steam curled up as the women, with
lively chatter, uncovered the <i>hangis</i> and arranged
the well-cooked food in little round flax baskets,
which they presently carried off, women and girls
in a double line, keeping time with a merry old
dance-song&mdash;the lilt of the "<i>tuku-kai</i>" the "food-bringing"&mdash;as
they marched on to the green <i>marae</i>
and laid the steaming meal before their lounging
lords.</p>

<p>It was all very pleasant and idyllic from the
point of view of the brown bushmen. But "Ringiringi,"
the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori, though he led by no
means a hard life now that the heaviest work of
the year was over, had an uneasy mind. He was&mdash;or
had been&mdash;a civilised man, and he could not
forget; moreover, he often woke from unpleasant
dreams. One was a vision of a British regiment
charging him with fixed bayonets and pinning
him against the palisades of his <i>pa</i>. Fervently he
hoped that he would not be in the fort when the
troops marched to the assault, and that the Hauhaus
would not compel him to level a <i>tupara</i> against
his one-time comrades, the old "Die-Hards."</p>

<p>This peaceful state of things did not endure for
long. In a few days&mdash;it was early in the year 1866&mdash;the
long-expected attack on Otapawa was delivered.
Before the troops came, however, the
prophet of the <i>pa</i> ordered all the old people and
most of the women and children to retire to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
forest in rear of the fort, and told "Ringiringi" to
accompany them. News had just been brought
in that the scouts out in the fern country had
noticed signs of an impending movement in the
British camp. The white man and the tribal
encumbrances pushed back into the bush for about
three miles, and camped in a quiet little nook by
a creek-side, with high, forested hills towering
around. The weather now became cold and bleak,
and there was little food to sustain the refugees,
for the principal stores of <i>kai</i> had been left in the <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>Early one morning the sound of cannon was
heard in the distance, then heavy rifle-volleying,
followed by desultory firing.</p>

<p>The Queen's soldiers were storming the fort.</p>

<p>Here I may give a more detailed description of
the defences of Otapawa than has appeared in the
preceding pages, to enable the reader to realise the
sort of place the white general was attacking.
Curving round under the rear of the <i>pa</i> and partly
protecting it on the flanks, flowed the Tangahoé
River. The hill-top where the <i>pa</i> stood was flat,
and the rear dropped precipitously to the Tangahoé.
The only access to the interior of the stockade was
through a low and narrow gateway. Just within,
the entrance was blinded by a short fence, so that
an enemy could not charge straight, even if the
gate were open, but would have to turn first to the
left for a short distance and then to the right, exposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to a fire from between the palisades, before the
open <i>marae</i> was reached. The <i>pa</i> was defended
by two rows of palisading, with a ditch between,
and another shallow trench inside the inner stockade.
The outer stockade, the <i>pekerangi</i>, was about
eight feet high, and was the lighter fence of the two.
The principal timbers were six or eight inches
thick, but the stakes between were smaller and
did not quite reach the ground; they were fastened
with bush-vines and supplejack to the sapling
rails that ran along the stockade. The open spaces
at the bottom of the fence were for the defenders
in the outer trench to fire through. The inner
fence, the <i>tuwatawata</i>, was a stouter structure, of
strong, green tree-trunks set solidly in the ground,
and with openings here and there for rifle-fire.
And finally&mdash;an important thing in Maori eyes&mdash;there
was the "luck-stone" of the fort, the greenstone
<i>whatu</i>. This was buried under the foot
of a large stockade post, close to the right-hand
corner nearest the river, as one approached from
the <i>pa</i> gate.</p>

<p>It was soon after daylight that the <i>pa</i> was attacked.
The assailing British force was assisted
by some Colonial troops and a contingent of
"friendly" Maoris, or <i>Kupapas</i>, chiefly men from
the Wanganui district, under the afterwards
celebrated bush-fighter, Kepa te Rangihiwinui
(Major Kemp). General Chute commanded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
operations. An Armstrong gun was brought to
within a short distance of the hill-fort, and several
shells were fired into the stockade. Then the
general gave the order for the assault.</p>

<p>As the storming party of Imperial soldiers, with
bayonets fixed, doubled eagerly up the hill face to
the front stockade, the Hauhau chiefs, Tukino and
Tu-ahi-pa, cried to their men, crouching in the
outer trench with levelled guns:</p>

<p>"Sons! Be steady, and wait till they come close
up, then let them have it!"</p>

<p>As the first files of the soldiers dashed up to
the stockade, "<i>Puhia!</i>"&mdash;"Fire!"&mdash;shouted the
chiefs, and under the thundering volley many
whites fell. Another volley, and then the soldiers
were at the stockade, firing through the gaps in
the obstruction, and slashing at the ties of the
fence. Hand-grenades were carried by some of
the stormers, and one of these bursting in the
outer trench wounded fierce old Tu-ahi-pa, who
had just killed a soldier in the act of cutting away
at the <i>pekerangi</i> in an endeavour to force an entrance.</p>

<p>The Maoris did not wait for the bayonet. The
wild rush of the maddened troops was irresistible.
Leaving seven of their men killed in the trenches
and about the palisades, the defenders gathered
their wounded and fled. The trenches led to the
steep bank overlooking the Tangahoé River. Down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the trenches they ran, and sliding down the bank,
they took to the bush, scrambling up along the
river-side as hard as they could go. Kepa, with his
Whanganui friendlies, pursued the flying Hauhaus
and shot two or three.</p>

<p>As Bent had expected, it was his old regiment,
the 57th, that stormed the <i>pa</i>. The 57th were led
by Lieutenant-Colonels Butler and Haszard, and
were supported by the 14th regiment, who were
very jealous of the famous old "Die-Hards."
Eleven whites fell and twenty were wounded.
One of those who received his death-wound was
Lieutenant-Colonel Haszard. It was generally reported
afterwards that he was shot by Kimble
Bent, but this was mere camp gossip. Gudgeon's
"Reminiscences of the War in New Zealand," gives
currency to the report, but it is strongly denied,
and with every appearance of truth, by Bent.
When the <i>pa</i> was attacked he was at least three
miles away, on the northern side of the Mangemange
stream. "It is false to say that I killed
my old officer," says he, "or that I ever even
fired at him. I never fired a shot against the
whites all the time I was with the Hauhaus."
This is confirmed by the Maoris, who say that
Bent was not allowed to handle a gun in an engagement
for fear he might use it against the Hauhaus
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The refugees in the bush-camp with Bent waited
anxiously for news of the fight. Was it a victory
or a defeat? Soon, the first of the defenders of
the <i>pa</i> dropped into camp, blood-stained and
angry. And then, as the afternoon went on, the
rest straggled in. Many were wounded, and seven
dead bodies were carried in on hastily made litters
of supplejack vines lashed to poles. Then the full
story of the battle was told.</p>

<p>It was a sad and angry camp, that remote pocket
between the hills. Most of the Hauhaus came in
nearly naked, just as they had jumped up when the
first shot was fired in the grey dawn. They were
desperately sullen and grief-stricken over their dead
and the loss of their stronghold, which to them had
seemed almost impregnable, for it was the strongest
stockaded position they had yet built. Many a dark
look was bent upon the white man as he sat by one
of the fires, not daring to speak a word.</p>

<p>That night the camp was suddenly abandoned by
order of the Hauhau leader, who feared pursuit, not
by the Imperial soldiers, who had no relish for "bush-whacking"
at night&mdash;or, indeed, at any other time&mdash;but
by Kepa's Government warriors, hereditary
enemies of the Taranaki men. Hurriedly packing
on their shoulders what few belongings they had
managed to save from the <i>pa</i>, they set off in single
file through the thick forest, making for the banks
of the Tangahoé River, which they reached before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
daylight, and there halted. The wounded who were
unable to walk were carried with difficulty through
the tangled bush, where it was often necessary to
cut away at the supplejacks and <i>aka</i> vines, so intricately
interlaced and festooned across their path,
before a passage could be made for the litter-bearers.
There was no moon; it was an intensely dark night,
rendered more Cimmerian still by the unbroken roof
of foliage overhead. The Hauhaus made torches of
pieces of dry pinewood, bound together with scraps
of flax torn from their scanty mat garments, and
with these they managed to dimly light their way
through the forest&mdash;a wild and savage band; the
warriors in front and rear, their cartouche-belts over
their naked shoulders, and guns slung across their
backs, or carried in their left hands; in their right
they gripped their tomahawks and slashed away at
the twining impediments of the jungle.</p>

<p>A camp was made near the banks of the Tangahoé,<a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a>
<a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and here, as soon as it was light, the Hauhaus mustered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and reckoned up their losses. There were
about three hundred and fifty of them now in camp&mdash;men,
women and children. With wonderful
celerity the forest-men cut a little clearing, and
built <i>wharau</i>, or rough huts, of saplings, thatched
with the long fronds of the <i>nikau</i> palm and the
<i>mamaku</i> tree-fern. Here the wounded men were
attended to as well as the primitive methods of the
bush allowed. Women were sent out to search the
river-banks for flax-plants; the flax-roots were dug
up, boiled, and the resultant mucilaginous juice
poured over the gunshot and bayonet wounds. This
was the Maoris' most favoured method of treating
injuries of this character, and it generally bore good
results.</p>

<p>"Ringiringi" himself took a hand in the bush-surgery,
for he had watched army surgeons at
their work, and the Hauhau wounded, though most
of them preferred their own people's doctoring,
were grateful to the white man for his efforts to
ease their sufferings.</p>

<p>A picked band of the fugitives scouted back
through the forest and cautiously reconnoitred
their captured fort, which had been set on fire by
the troops, and was now a heap of blackened ruins.
The Government force had by this time passed on
to the attack of other <i>pas</i>, and the scouts re-entered
their destroyed fortress and searched for
their dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene in the camp by the Tangahoé waters
when the war-party returned from Otapawa was
one that "Ringiringi" never forgot. It was the
first great <i>tangihanga</i>, or wailing over the dead, that
he had witnessed. The people gathered in the
middle of the little clearing, and for hours the sound
of lamentation rang through the forest, often rising
into a wild, heart-breaking shriek as some blanket-draped
or mat-kilted woman, her long hair unbound,
and her cheeks streaming with tears, cried
her keening song for her slain. The chiefs <i>taki</i>'d up
and down, weapon in hand, and told of the deeds
of those who had fallen; each ended his mournful
speech with a chanted dirge. When the song was
a well-known one, the whole tribe would join in and
sing the lament with an intensity of feeling that
made their very bodies quiver. It was the full and
unrestrained outpouring of the soul of the savage.</p>

<p class="center">BUSH LIFE WITH THE HAUHAUS</p>

<p class="blockquote">Wild days in the forest&mdash;The Hauhau hunters&mdash;Maori

Ngaere&mdash;The slayer of Broughton&mdash;Another runaway soldier, and his
fate&mdash;The tomahawking of Humphrey Murphy.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some weeks the fugitives remained in their
well-hidden camp by the Tangahoé's stream. When
the wounded were able to travel, "Ringiringi" and
his Maori companions took them a few miles through
the bush to a place called Rimatoto, the overgrown
site of an olden village. All the able-bodied men
of the tribe now set to work to build a new settlement.
Thatched <i>nikau</i>-palm houses were quickly
run up, and the forest rang day after day with the
axes of the bush-fellers, clearing the ground for
potato-planting.</p>

<p>As it was intended to make this a permanent
<i>kainga</i>&mdash;always providing Kepa's dusky forest-rangers
did not find their way to it in their scouting
expeditions&mdash;a large clearing was made. The felled
trees were allowed to lie for about three months until
they were dry enough to be fired; then the potatoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
were set in amongst the half-burned stumps and logs.
In the meantime the forest was scoured for food,
and foraging parties were sent out to Turangaréré
and other villages on the outskirts of the forest and
returned laden with pork and potatoes, strapped
across their shoulders in the usual Maori <i>pikau</i>
fashion.</p>

<p>Four miles away by a rough bush track, a track
hardly discernible to any but a Maori, was the Maha
village. There the white man was taken by his
<i>rangatira</i> Tito, after the bush-felling work was over,
and three or four peaceful months were passed,
varied only by occasional armed scouting expeditions
to the forest edge, and by long fishing, birding,
and pig-hunting trips into the great wilderness of
jungle-matted timber that hemmed in the lonely
village on every side.</p>

<p>Bent had now been a year with the Maoris, and
had thoroughly settled into the native life. He had
quickly picked up the language of his adopted
people, and there was nothing of the <i>pakeha</i> about
him but the colour of his skin, and that was browning
with constant exposure and outdoor labour. A
waist-shawl or a flax kilt was his single article of
everyday clothing; in cold weather a shoulder-mat
or a blanket was added. In this village of the woods
there were few emblems of civilisation except the
weapons of the warriors. Stories of battle and
skirmish now and again reached the bushmen by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
messengers from the plains; and the white general's
great march through the forest from Ketemarae by
the Whakaahurangi track around the eastern side
of Mount Egmont to Mataitawa and New Plymouth&mdash;when
the soldiers fell so short of food that they had
to shoot and eat their pack-horses&mdash;was discussed
many a night in the village <i>wharepuni</i>, the communal
council-room and sleeping-house.</p>

<p>Bent's half-Indian temperament soon adapted
itself to this wild life in the forest. No drill day
after day, no parades, no sentry-go, no buttons to
polish, and no uniform to mend&mdash;surely this savage
life had its compensations. When the Maoris had
urgent and laborious work on hand they worked
like fury, and compelled&mdash;with the spur of a tomahawk&mdash;the
white man to toil with equal industry,
if not willingness. Fort-building, trench-digging and
timber-felling were undertakings in which the whole
strength of the community laboured from dawn
till dark, and the chiefs as hard as the common men
and slaves. It was warrior's work. But there were
periods of halcyon, lazy days in Maoridom, when
"Ringiringi" and his ragged comrades of the bush,
their work over, could just "lie around" and smoke
and eat, and take no thought for the morrow so long
as they could procure a pipe-full of strong <i>torori</i>
(tobacco) and a square meal of potatoes and pork.
Tito proved a not unkind master, when he found
that his white man neither attempted to escape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
from the tribe nor shirked the often heavy tasks
imposed upon him.</p>

<p>The <i>paheka</i> soon became an adept in the wood-craft
of the Maoris. He accompanied the young
men of the tribe on their forest expeditions, bird-snaring
and bird-spearing; these camping-out trips
sometimes lasted for a week or more. Far into the
solitudes of the great woods the little hunting-parties
penetrated, always armed, for they never knew when
or where the Government Maori scouts might be
encountered. The days were spent in birding and
pig-hunting, and the long nights by the blazing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
camp-fire, when the white man learned from his
Hauhau comrades many a wild legend and folk-story,
hair-raising tales of witchcraft, and mournful
<i>tangi</i>-songs and love-ditties without end.</p>

<p>Powder and shot were too valuable to waste on the
birds of the forest in those days. One of the Maori
snaring methods, as practised by "Ringiringi"
and his companions, was to cut out wooden <i>waka</i>,
or miniature canoes or troughs, fill them with water,
and place them in some dry spot in the forest where
pigeons and <i>tui</i> were plentiful. Just over these
troughs flax-snares were arranged, so that when
the birds, thirsting for water after feasting on the
bush-berries, flew down to drink, and stretched their
heads through the running loops, they were tightly
noosed. Other snares were set on the <i>miro</i>-trees,
of whose sweet berries the pigeons and <i>tui</i> were
particularly fond. "Ringiringi" quickly learned
the art of setting snares of flax or cabbage-tree leaf
with cunning slip-loops in the branches of the fruit-laden
<i>miro</i>; in a clump of these pines he sometimes
caught in a single day as many as three hundred or
four hundred birds&mdash;<i>kaka</i> parrots, <i>tui</i>, and pigeon&mdash;for
the forests were alive with feathered creatures,
and in the autumn time, when the wild fruits were
ripe and abundant, they were to be taken with little
trouble; the noisy <i>kaka</i> parrot was the most easily
lured of all. The only forest bird that was not welcomed
by the hunters was the owl, or <i>ruru</i>; should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
one happen to be killed it was never eaten, because
in Maori eyes it was an <i>atua</i>, a spirit or the incarnation
of a tribal deity.</p>

<p>Bird-spearing was another forest art widely practised
in those times. Long slender limber spears
of <i>tawa</i> wood, twelve feet long and more, were
used.</p>

<p>In making the bird-spears, the pole from which
each was cut was scorched with fire till very dry, then
it was scraped and scraped down with <i>pawa</i>-shells
and scorched again, and once more scraped and
shaped with great care and industry, until it had
been reduced to the size desired and was perfectly
smooth. These spears were armed with barbed
tips, often of bone, sometimes of iron. The villagers
trailed the weapons after them as they travelled
through the forest, until they came to some tree
where <i>tui</i> and pigeon perched in numbers; then
the spear was slowly and cautiously pushed upwards
until close to the unsuspecting bird, and a sudden,
sharp thrust impaled it on the barbed point.</p>

<p>The <i>pakeha</i> was carefully schooled in the art of
using the spear, and was enjoined, above all, never
to strike the pigeon full in the breast, because the
bone would often snap the barb-tip off; it must be
speared in the side. In the late autumn the pigeons
were "rolling fat"; and many hundreds of them
were preserved or potted in Maori fashion by the
birding-parties in <i>taha</i>, or calabashes (the <i>hué</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
gourd), which were hermetically sealed with the
fat of the cooked birds.</p>

<p>One foraging expedition which Bent accompanied
was farther afield than usual, up northwards to the
great Ngaere swamp, a huge morass near where the
present township of Eltham stands, and where dairy
cattle now graze on fields that in those days of '66
were seemingly irreclaimable bogs and wildernesses;
lagoons, where millions of eels crawled, snake-like,
in the ooze, and where countless thousands of wild
fowl and water-birds fished and screamed and
squabbled all day long. To the edge of the great
swamp came the food-hunters; they waded across
to the two islets which rose from the middle of the
bog&mdash;ancient refuge-places of fugitive tribes&mdash;and
camped there, catching and smoke-drying huge
quantities of eels for winter food in the home <i>kainga</i>,
and snaring many ducks and other birds. In this
primeval spot the beautiful <i>kotuku</i>, the white heron
so famous in Maori song and proverb&mdash;now never
seen in the North Island&mdash;then abounded; the
white man often admired this graceful bird as he
stood on silent watch on the marge of some sedgy
pool, then, like lightning-flash, darted his long spear-bill
on his prey. The birds were tame, and easily
caught, and many were snared and eaten by the
foragers. "Ringiringi" captured some on the shores
of the lagoon by the simple expedient of a bent
supplejack and an arrangement of flax loops, set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
near the <i>kotuku's</i> daily haunts; a day seldom passed
without a heron being found flapping and choking
tightly noosed in the snares of the fowlers.</p>

<p>One day in the spring of 1866, when Tito and
his <i>hapu</i>, their bird-hunting expeditions over for
the season, were gathered in their bush-village Rimatoto,
three strange Maoris, fully armed, entered the
settlement. They had travelled overland from the
King Country, far to the north, on a mission from
Tawhiao, the Waikato King, who, after the conquest
of the Waikato Valley by the white troops,
had taken refuge with the Ngati-Maniapoto tribe.
The envoys had been sent down to recover some
Waikato war-flags which were in the possession of
the Taranaki Hauhaus.</p>

<p>In the crowded <i>wharepuni</i> that night, when the
Waikato warriors made their errand known, one
of them caught sight of the white man, sitting
silently in his corner, and asked who he was. When
Tito explained, the visitor asked,</p>

<p>"Why don't you kill him?"</p>

<p>"He is my <i>pakeha</i>," said Tito, "and I will protect
him, because our prophet Te Ua has <i>tapu</i>'d him,
and ordered us not to harm him."</p>

<p>"That is indeed a soft and foolish way to deal with
<i>pakehas</i>" exclaimed a fierce-looking young warrior,
one of the Waikato trio. "We don't take any white
prisoners in our country. You ought to have his
head stuck on the fence of your <i>pa</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Tito laughed. "Ringiringi is going to be
useful to us," he said. "Besides, he is a Maori
now."</p>

<p>Next morning Tito despatched the white man and
an old Maori named Te Waka-tapa-ruru through
the forest to Te Putahi, a stockaded village some
ten miles away, on the banks of the Whenuakura
River, with a message to the people of that <i>pa</i> requesting
them to return the colours for which the
king had sent. This mission accomplished, Bent
stayed a while in Te Putahi, where he was treated
with much kindness, because of his association with
Tito.</p>

<p>On the morning after his arrival a man came to
his sleeping-hut and, without saying a word, placed
on the mat before him a couple of blankets and a
watch.</p>

<p>The history of the watch was afterwards explained
to him by Te Waka-tapa-ruru. This warrior was
a typical old bush-fighter. He had a very big
head; he was tattooed on the cheeks; he was
wiry and wonderfully quick on his legs. He told
Bent, with a devilish grin on his corrugated face,
that the watch had belonged to a white man,
called Paratene, whom he&mdash;Te Waka&mdash;had shot
the previous year at Otoia, on the Patea River.
This <i>pakeha</i> was Mr. C. Broughton, a native interpreter
who had been sent on a special Government
mission to the Hauhaus, and was barbarously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
murdered while in the act of lighting his pipe in
the village <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>Broughton's slayer, despite his repulsive antecedents,
became a friend of Bent's, and they were
close comrades until 1869, when the old man was
killed in the act of charging furiously on the Armed
Constabulary at the attack on the Papa-tihakehake
stockade.</p>

<p>At Te Putahi "Ringiringi" was astonished to
find another white man, clothed like himself in a
blanket. This man walked up and greeted him, and
the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori recognised the long-haired, rough-bearded
fellow as an old fellow-soldier. His name
was Humphrey Murphy; he, too, had been a
private in the 57th, and had become as dissatisfied
with the life as Bent had done, and deserted to the
Hauhaus. Bent sums him up as "a bad lot."
Murphy was an evil-tempered Irishman, faithful to
neither white man nor Maori. He belonged to two
chiefs, Te Onekura and Wharé-matangi, who lived
in the <i>pa</i> at Te Putahi.</p>

<p>Murphy, it appeared from his own story, had been
taken over as a <i>taurekareka</i>, a slave, by one of the
Hauhau chiefs when he deserted, and had been
sent as a food-carrier to Te Putahi by his owner,
who treated his "white trash" with scant consideration.
At Te Putahi he had been taken over by the
two local chiefs. The deserter bragged to Bent,
as they sat side by side on the village <i>marae</i>, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
he would shortly return to his old Maori "boss,"
as he called him, and kill him, and take what money
he could find as payment for his enforced labour.</p>

<p>While Murphy was speaking, a young Maori girl
sat by quietly listening.</p>

<p>When the runaway soldier rose and walked off
to his hut, the girl said:</p>

<p>"Ringi, I heard what that <i>taurekareka</i> white
man was saying. I have learned enough of the
<i>pakeha's</i> tongue to know that he is going to kill his
<i>rangatira</i> and steal his money."</p>

<p>"<i>Kaati!</i> Don't say a word about it," cautioned
Bent.</p>

<p>But the girl rose up in the meeting-house one
night after "Ringiringi" had departed to his home
at Rimatoto, and repeated the threat she had overheard
from Murphy's lips.</p>

<p>That settled the <i>taurekareka's</i> fate. Bent, some
time later, inquiring after Murphy from one of
Tito's men who had been on a visit to Te Putahi,
was told that he had been killed. The Hauhaus
had a short way with such as he. He was quietly
tomahawked one night as he lay asleep, and his
despised remains dragged out and cast into the
Whenuakura River that ran below the village.</p>

<p>At this time there were at least four white men living
with the Hauhaus in South Taranaki. One came
to Rimatoto to see "Ringiringi," and remained with
him for a week. His name was Jack Hennessy, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
he had, like Bent, deserted from the 57th Regiment.
He was in fact the "shut-eye sentry" who had seen
Bent steal off from the Manawapou camp in 1865.
He gave himself up to the white forces some time
later, tired of life with the Hauhaus, and was court-martialled
and sent to prison.</p>

<p class="center">THE HAUHAU COUNCIL-TOWN</p>

<p class="blockquote">Life in Taiporohenui&mdash;A great praying-house&mdash;The ritual of the
<i>Niu</i>&mdash;Singular Hauhau chants&mdash;"<i>Matua Pai-mariré</i>"&mdash;Bent's new
owner, and his new wife&mdash;The tattooers&mdash;Another white renegade</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> summer came, and the crops were gathered
in, and the men of Tito's <i>hapu</i>, after nearly a year
of comparative peace, wearied for the war-path
again. Rimatoto and other small bush-hamlets
were deserted, and the tribes gathered in, bearing
their food supplies to the Hauhau council-village
of Taiporohenui&mdash;close to where the town of Hawera
now stands. Taiporohenui was a famous name&mdash;a
word of <i>mana</i>, as the Maori would say&mdash;amongst
all the tribes from Whanganui to Waikato. The
name, say the wise men of Taranaki, goes back far
beyond the days of the later Maori migration to New
Zealand, in the canoes Aotea, Tokomaru, Tainui,
and other Polynesian Viking ships. It was that of
a great temple in Tahiti, in the tropic isles of the
Hawaiikian seas, countless generations ago. And
in this latter-day Taiporohenui the Maoris, mindful
of their ancient traditions, built another temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>This Hauhau praying-house and council-hall, constructed
of hewn timber with <i>raupo</i>-reed walls and
<i>nikau</i>-thatch roof, is described by Bent as the largest
building of native construction that he had seen.
It was about one hundred and twenty feet in length,
and was of such exceptional size that the ridge-pole
was supported by four <i>poutoko-manawa</i>, or pillars,
instead of one or two, as in the ordinary Maori
meeting-house; there were five fires burning in it
at night, in the stone fireplaces down its long central
aisle; on either side were the mat-covered resting-places
of the people. The timbers of the house were
of the durable <i>totara</i> pine. The inside was lined with
beautiful <i>tukutuku</i> work, of <i>kakaho</i> reeds and thin
wooden lathes artfully fastened with <i>kiekie</i> fibre,
arranged in many handsome geometrical patterns.
Beneath the first large <i>poutoko-manawa</i> in the house
was buried a large piece of greenstone in the rough,
the <i>whatu</i>, or "luck-stone," of the sacred house. It
was the Maori custom when the centre-pole of a
large meeting-house or the first big palisade-post of
a fort was set in position, to place a piece of greenstone,
often in the form of an ornament, such as an
ear-drop or a carved <i>tiki</i>, at its foot.<a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a>
<a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of the great house on the <i>marae</i>, or village
square, stood the sacred <i>Niu</i>-pole, a <i>totara</i> pine
flagstaff, nearly fifty feet in height, with a yard
about fourteen feet long; the staff was stayed like
the mast of a ship. The war-flags of the Hauhaus
were flown from the <i>Niu</i>, and the people daily
marched around its foot in their "<i>Pai-mariré</i>" procession,
intoning the chants their prophet had taught
them. This <i>Niu</i> was one of the first worship-poles
planted in Taranaki by the Hauhau prophet's command,
and it was the centre of many a wild fanatic
gathering. At its foot there was planted a large
piece of unworked greenstone&mdash;as was done when
the first house-pillar was set up&mdash;as the <i>whatu</i> of
the sacred pole; this block of <i>pounamu</i> is still there,
says Bent.</p>

<p>Round this staff of worship, where the bright war-flags
hung, the people marched daily in their strange
procession, chanting their wild psalms. Tito te
Hanataua was one of the priests of the <i>Niu</i>, and he
led his tribe in the services after the Hauhau religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the chants were amazing mixtures of English
and Maori; some were all pidgin-English, softened
by the melodious Maori tongue. Here is a specimen
of the daily chants, intoned by all the people as they
marched round and round the holy pole. The priest
shouted, "<i>Porini, hoia!</i>" ("Fall in, soldiers!");
then "<i>Teihana!</i>" ("Attention!"), and they stood
waiting. Then they chanted, as they got the
order to march:</p>

<p>The more warlike chants ended in a loudly barked
"<i>Hau!</i>" the watchword and holy war-cry of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
rebel bushmen. Very wild they were, these savage
hymns, haunting in rhythm, and stirring the people
to a frenzy of fanatic fire.</p>

<p>Kimble Bent joined in these Hauhau war-rites
like any Maori, and marched, chanting with his wild
comrades, round and round the <i>Niu</i>.</p>

<p>Several skirmishes between the whites and Maoris
occurred in the winter and early spring of 1866, and
one of these had some concern for the exile. About
three miles away from Taiporohenui was a village
called Pokaikai, to which "Ringiringi" was sent
awhile by his chief. While he was there the prophet
Te Ua arrived. He dreamed a dream, one of bad
omen, and he straightway counselled "Ringiringi"
to return at once to Taiporohenui. "Ringi"
obeyed. Three days, or, rather, three nights afterwards,
a force of colonial soldiers under Colonel
McDonnell unexpectedly attacked Pokaikai and
rushed the village, killing several Hauhaus. In some
way the Forest Rangers under McDonnell had heard
that the deserter Kimble Bent was in Pokaikai,
and they were eager to capture or shoot him. Some
of them surrounded one of the <i>wharés</i> in which they
imagined Bent was sleeping. A young volunteer
named Spain had just previously, unnoticed by
them, gone into the <i>wharé</i> to bring out a dead
Hauhau, and while he was there the Rangers&mdash;hearing
some one say there was a white man within&mdash;fired
a volley into the hut, which unfortunately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mortally wounded Spain. This young soldier was
the only <i>pakeha</i> killed in the fight.</p>

    the Maori War, with his wife Takiora.<br />

</div>

<p>When "Ringiringi" heard of the Pokaikai affair
from the fugitives who fled through the bush to
Taiporohenui, he felt that the Hauhau prophet
had indeed been his good angel, for it was only Te
Ua's injunction to return to the main Hauhau camp
that had saved him from the vengeful bullets of his
fellow-whites. And thenceforward the white man
was a dreamer of many a strange dream, and he came
to believe almost as implicitly as the forest-men
themselves in the omens that lay in the visions of
the night, and in warning voices from the spirit-world.</p>

<p>About this time "Ringiringi" changed hands,
much as if he were a fat porker or a keg of powder
or any other article of Maori barter. Rupé ("Wood-pigeon"),
a chief of Taiporohenui, made request
of Tito&mdash;to whom he was related&mdash;for his <i>pakeha
mokai</i>, his tame white man. He had never owned
a <i>pakeha</i>, he explained, and would like one all to
himself, and he knew that "Ringiringi" would be
a handy man to have around, to keep his armoury
of guns, of miscellaneous makes and dates, in repair,
and to make cartridges for him. So "Ringiringi"
was passed over to his new owner, whom he served,
with the exception of some short intervals in the
war-time and in the period of exile on the Upper
Waitara, until 1878.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after "Ringiringi" had become one of
Rupé's household, his chief's son, a young lad named
Kuku (another name for the wood-pigeon), fell
seriously ill. The white man doctored and carefully
nursed the boy, and under his treatment he
recovered. Rupé's gratitude to his <i>mokai</i> took a
chieftain-like form. As payment, or <i>utu</i>, for curing
his son, he led up his daughter, a young girl of fifteen
or sixteen, and presented her to "Ringiringi" as
his wife.</p>

<p>"Indeed, she was a pretty girl," says the old
<i>pakeha</i>-Maori, recalling the dead past. "I'll never
forget her. She had handsome features, almost
European, though she was of pure Maori blood.
Her lips were small, her hair was wavy and curly,
instead of hanging in a straight, black mat, and she
had what was very strange in a Maori, blue eyes&mdash;the
first blue-eyed native I have ever seen. She
was a very gentle girl&mdash;she never <i>kanga</i>'d or said
unpleasant things about others, never quarrelled
with the other women. She did not smoke either,
which was unusual. Her chin was tattooed, but
not too thickly or deeply. She had, too, the <i>rapé</i>
and <i>tiki-hopé</i> patterns engraved on her body, the
hip, and thigh, tattooing which was in fashion in
those days, and which the girls and women were
proud of displaying when they went out to bathe."</p>

<p>With this agreeable young wife, whose name was
Rihi, or Te Hau-roroi-ua, Bent lived for nearly three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
years. She bore one child, which died, and soon
after she, too, died, to the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori's great
sorrow. His one-eyed wife, the lady of Otapawa,
had left her unwilling husband some months before
he took Rihi in Maori marriage.</p>

<p>Amongst the primitive arts of the Maori with
which "Ringiringi" became familiar about this
time was that of <i>moko</i>, or tattooing. The <i>kauae</i>
tattooing&mdash;on chin and lips&mdash;was still universal
amongst the native women, though few of the men
now submitted their faces to the chisel or the needle
of the tattooing artist. A popular form of tattooing
amongst both sexes was that technically known as
<i>tiki-hopé</i>, the scroll-patterns on the thighs and other
parts of the body usually concealed by the waist-shawl.
The white man saw numbers of women
as well as men decorated in this fantastic fashion.
In fact, he was so thoroughly Maori by this time
that he was about to undergo the operation himself,
in the winter of 1867, when living at the village Te
Paka, near the old fort Otapawa. He had the
<i>ngarahu</i>, or <i>kapara</i>, the blue-black pigment, ready
for the dusky engraver, and would shortly have been
made pretty for life in Maori eyes had not the
tattooing been peremptorily forbidden.</p>

<p>"I wanted my face tattooed," says Bent, "for
I was as wild as any Maori then. I intended to have
the curves called <i>tiwhana</i>, or arches, tattooed on my
forehead, over the eyes, and the <i>kawekawe</i> lines on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the cheeks, extending to the corners of the mouth.
What a curiosity I would have been, though, when
I came out of the bush! I would have been able
to earn my living in my old age, going on exhibition,
like the bearded lady in the circus!"</p>

<p>It was Te Ua the prophet who forbade the tattooing.
He happened to be in residence at Te Paka
just then, and he reminded "Ringiringi" that he
had <i>tapu</i>'d him, and explained that to <i>moko</i> his skin
would be a violation of that particular brand of <i>tapu</i>.
To the white man this was not quite clear; nevertheless,
he agreed to obey the prophet's Mosaic
command "to make no cuttings" in his flesh, and
remained a plain, undecorated <i>pakeha</i>.</p>

<p>However, he acquired some skill himself with the
tattooing instruments, and exercised it in printing
names and sundry devices on the persons of the
villagers. He learned, too, how to manufacture
the indelible <i>ngarahu</i>, or <i>kapara</i>, pigment. In
making this tattooing-ink the soot from fires of
white-pine (<i>kahikatea</i>) wood was used. A cave-like
hole was dug in the side of a bank, with an opening
resembling a chimney in the top. A large fire was
kindled in the cave, or <i>rua</i>, and for several days was
constantly fed with the resinous timber of the
<i>kahikatea</i>. Above the earth-chimney were arranged
a number of twigs of the <i>karamu</i> shrub (a coprosma),
with the bark stripped off, set up in the shape of a
tent, and covered with a layer of leaves. The dense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
smoke from the fire deposited a thick soot on the
<i>karamu</i> sticks. For some days the fire was kept up;
then the twigs were removed, and the soot scraped
off into wooden receptacles. It was mixed with
water, and worked into little round balls. The soot-balls
were then placed on a layer of <i>poroporo</i> leaves
in an <i>umu</i>, or earth-oven, and steamed for about
three hours, when they were taken out and set to
dry. In later times, after the war, Bent often employed
himself in the manufacture of this tattoo-dye;
and was, he says, accustomed to receive ten
shillings for a ball of <i>ngarahu</i> the size of a peach.</p>

<p>To Te Paka village there came one day another
renegade white man, an Irish soldier named Charles
Kane, or King. He had been a private in the second
battalion of the 18th Royal Irish Regiment, and
had, like Bent, revolted against army discipline,
and deserted to the Hauhaus. The Maoris had
christened him "Kingi." He lived in Bent's <i>wharé</i>
in Te Paka for some time. He was exceedingly
bitter against his old officers, and, in fact, against
his fellow-whites in general; so much so, that he
boasted of his intention to fight against them, and,
as will be seen later, actually did so in the attack on
the Turuturu-mokai redoubt. Like most of the
soldiers who traitorously deserted their colours in
those war-days, he fell at last a victim to the tomahawks
of his Hauhau companions.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The two eel-fishers&mdash;Bivouac in the bush&mdash;A murderous attack&mdash;The
Waikato's tomahawk&mdash;"Ringiringi's" escape.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> away to the east and north of the great Hauhau
council-camp stretched the forest, clothing hill and
valley with one endless wavy garment of unvarying
green. For weeks one might tramp through these
vast, jungly woods and not see or hear sign of man,
or of any living thing but the twittering birds in the
tree-tops and a stray wild pig rooting in the soft,
fern-matted earth or scampering away through the
thickets. The free, unspoiled wilderness of Tane-Mahuta.</p>

<p>Climbing to the wooded crest of some of the steep
little hills that rose from the gently undulating plain,
one might here and there, through the gaps between
the towering tiers of foliage, catch narrow glimpses
of the surrounding country; and perhaps far away
to the nor'-west see between the branches, set like
a picture in its forest-frame, the pure white snow-cone
of tent-shaped Taranaki.</p>

<p>Deep in these bush solitudes one day, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
spring had come, the voice of man broke upon the
silences. The wild boar stopped his root-foraging to
listen, and then turned and crashed off through the
supplejacks. A band of brown men, some clad in
nondescript articles of European clothing, some
wearing only a shoulder-cape of flax and a shawl or
blanket-kilt, wound in single file through the bush,
striking due east. There were fourteen or fifteen
of them. Most of them carried weapons&mdash;double-barrelled
guns and short-handled tomahawks, stuck
in the waist-belt of flax; all had large flax baskets,
some containing gourd-calabashes, strapped across
their backs. Some sang little lilts of Maori song,
and some called now and then to the others, or
mimicked the <i>tui</i> and the <i>kaka</i> parrot that cried
above them in the trees.</p>

<p>Mid-line in the file was a fairer-skinned young
forester, bare-footed like the rest, clad only in a
"home-made" shirt that seemed to have been
cut out of a blanket and a coloured shawl strapped
round his waist. He had a thick beard, and his hair
was so long that it would have fallen down over his
shoulders had it not been caught at the back of his
neck and tied with a piece of flax. This was "Ringiringi,"
the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori, wearing as little clothing
as his Hauhau companions, and to all appearance
as seasoned a bushman as they, as he bent along
the jungly way with the easy, noiseless jog of the
Maori scout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>This party had been despatched from Taiporohenui
by Rupé, to work inland through the bush
to the upper waters of the Patea River, and scour
the country for food supplies for the assembled
tribes. They were ordered to bring home wild pork
and wild honey, and to catch as many eels as they
could carry. They travelled far into the heart of
the bush, and then divided into small parties of twos
and threes for eel-catching in the creeks.</p>

<p>The white man's companion on the eel-fishing
excursion was an old Maori from the "King"
Country, a Ngati-Maniapoto man, who had joined
the Taranaki Hauhaus; he was a short but strongly
built fellow, with a big head and of dark and sullen
visage, made more forbidding still by the blue-black
tattoo with which cheeks and brow and nose were
scrolled and lined. The couple, leaving the others
after arranging a general rendezvous for the following
day, selected a small creek, winding in a slow, brown
current beneath the roof of verdure which the outstretching
branches of the <i>rata</i> and the pines nearly
everywhere held over it. It was a tributary of the
Upper Patea above Rukumoana. They fished with
short rods and flax lines, with worms for bait, and
by the evening had caught between them about
sixty good-sized eels.</p>

<p>The eel-fishers bivouacked where the twilight
found them, in a tiny nook near Orangimura, where
there was just room to build their camp-fire and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
spread their bush-couches of fresh-pulled tree-fern
fronds, between the buttressed <i>ratas</i> and the creek-side.</p>

<p>"Ringiringi" had a little cold food in his <i>pikau</i>
kit, potatoes and <i>kopaki</i> corn; that is, maize in the
sheath. He was about to grill some of the fat eels
on the fire when his Maori companion stopped him.</p>

<p>"<i>E tama!</i>" he said. "Don't you know it is
unlucky to cook the <i>tuna</i> in the night-time? Do
not touch those eels until the morning; should you
disobey, it will surely bring heavy rain."</p>

<p>The superstitious old warrior was so insistent that
"Ringiringi," to please him, agreed to his wishes;
he contented himself with the little he had in his kit,
and then, filling his pipe with <i>torori</i> tobacco, lit it,
and smoked as he lay beside the camp-fire. His
Maori mate squatted smoking on the other side.</p>

<p>The warmth of the fire, and the low, murmurous
singing of the little river&mdash;the <i>wawara-wai</i>, the
babble of the waters, in the musical Maori tongue&mdash;pleasantly
lulled the tired <i>pakeha</i>. He lay there,
with his scanty bush-ranging garments wrapped
about him, listening, half-asleep, to the lazy run of
the creek, and to the songs that his savage old companion
recited to himself in a monotonous chant.
War-songs of Waikato, songs that he and his Kingite
comrades had shouted in many an armed camp
before the white man drove them out beyond the
<i>Aukati</i> line, the frontier of the Waikato. In one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of these chants the eel-fisher's voice was lifted in a
quick burst of passionate remembrance&mdash;a defiant
<i>haka</i>-song the Hauhaus of Taranaki, too, had
adopted as a composition exactly expressing their
opinion of <i>pakehas</i> in general, and of the <i>pakeha</i>
Governor in particular. It likened Governor Grey
to a bush-bullock devouring the tender leaves of
the <i>raurekau</i> shrub&mdash;a Maori simile for the land-hunger
of the whites:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The old Hauhau, warming to the <i>haka</i>, almost
yelled the virulent words. The chant broke the
white man's drowsing, and he sat up and listened
as his companion repeated the vigorous dance-song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, <i>pakeha</i>!" he said; "that is our Waikato
<i>ngeri</i>, our war-cry. That is what we think of the
Governor&mdash;and of all <i>pakehas</i>! I hate all white
men! They are thieves and pigs. I could cook
and eat them all! All, every one! I would not
leave a white-skin alive in this island! They are
slaves, <i>taurekarekas</i>&mdash;like you! Now go to sleep,
for we must rise when the <i>kaka</i> cries."</p>

<p>And the old man curled up by the fire, while
"Ringiringi" found uncomfortable reflection in
the fact that he was here alone, far in the heart of
the forest, with a murderous old savage who was
armed with a war-tomahawk, while he, the weaker
man, though the younger, had nothing with which
to defend himself. But by this time he was familiar
with the face of danger, and worked and slept in
the midst of alarms; so simply remarking to the
Maori, "Friend, I am sleepy," and throwing some
fresh fuel on the fire, he lay down again on his
ferny <i>whariki</i>.</p>

<p>However, he had his suspicions of the old savage,
and presently he glimpsed the Maori eyeing him
dangerously through his narrowed lids and handling
his tomahawk restlessly. When he lay down to
rest, the white man had drawn his blanket partly
over his face, as if he were asleep, but he kept one
eye lifting. Once the Maori half rose and looked
cunningly over at his companion, with his hand on
his war-axe, then he sank down again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The little dark brook went singing on beneath
the forest; the fire gradually burned lower and
lower as the night wore on; the morepork now and
then cried his sharp complaint of "<i>Kou-kou!</i>" from
the shadows. The two fishers lay silent; to all
appearance both were asleep. But in the Maori's
heart was black, treacherous murder.</p>

<p><i>Utu</i>&mdash;payment, satisfaction, revenge&mdash;summed
up in a word the darker side of the Maori character.</p>

<p>The lone <i>pakeha's</i> head would be indeed a trophy
to bear back through the wilderness to his tribe.
He would be a hero; he could brag to the end of
his days how he slew a white soldier in single combat,
and none could contradict him. He saw himself
already <i>taki</i>-ing and prancing up and down the
home <i>marae</i> before his admiring clan, the <i>pakeha's</i>
head in his hand, his tomahawk&mdash;the victor's tomahawk!&mdash;flashing
in air. Ah! That, indeed, would be
<i>utu</i>&mdash;though long-deferred <i>utu</i>&mdash;for his kinsmen who
fell to the <i>pakeha</i> bullets at Rangiriri and Orakau!</p>

<p>It must have been nearly midnight, and "Ringiringi"
was half-asleep with fatigue, in spite of his
fears, when suddenly all his senses were awakened.
Through his half closed eyelids he saw the Maori
rise, tomahawk in hand; he rose from his blanket
noiselessly, then cautiously stretched one foot across
a <i>tawa</i> log that lay on the fire, with its end projecting.
His eyes blazed, his face was frightful, with
intent to murder plain upon it in the firelight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>He was just in the act of stepping over the log,
with his little axe upraised, when the white man
suddenly threw off his blanket and leaped for the
savage.</p>

<p>The old fellow flew at him with his upraised tomahawk
glittering in the little light that the bivouac-fire
yet threw out.</p>

<p>But "Ringiringi" was too quick for him. He
ducked dexterously, and caught the Maori by the
ankle, and, with a lightning twist that he had learned
from his Taranaki people, threw him to the ground.</p>

<p>The murderer-in-intent fell on his back and
almost on the fire, and the tomahawk dropped
from his hand.</p>

<p>"Ringiringi" pounced on the furious old savage
as he fell, and with a knee on his bare chest, and one
hand on his throat, reached out with the free hand
for the tomahawk, which lay just within his grasp.</p>

<p>The Maori would have continued the struggle,
and in the rough-and-tumble would probably have
got the better of the white man, had not "Ringiringi,"
now roused to murderous mood himself,
threatened to split his head in two if he moved,
and emphasised his words by bringing the weapon
down until the blade was within an inch of the old
fellow's ugly, tattooed nose.</p>

<p>The Maori sulkily promising to lie quietly in his
sleeping-place for the rest of the night, the <i>pakeha</i>
relinquished his grip of the old man and backed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
his own side of the bivouac. He fed the fire with
dry branches of pine, and presently the little glade
was a blaze of light again, and the black tree-shadows
danced like forest-ghosts to the rising and
falling of the flames.</p>

<p>The old Maori pulled his blanket over his face
and pretended to go to sleep, but "Ringiringi" did
not take his eyes off him the rest of that night. He
sat by the fire till daylight, the captured tomahawk
between his knees.</p>

<p>In the morning the two enemies silently packed
their takes of eels in their kits, and slung them on
their backs by flax-leaf straps, for the home-journey.</p>

<p>The little river had to be forded. It was about
knee-deep. The Maori hung back, waiting for Bent
to cross first; but the white man knew that if he
did so his enemy would spring upon him or trip
him up and try to drown him in the creek.</p>

<p>"Now, you go first," ordered Bent, when he had
settled his <i>pikau</i> on his shoulders and stood, tomahawk
in hand, facing the Maori, "and walk in front
of me all the way home, or I'll kill you!"</p>

<p>So the old fellow sulkily stepped into the stream
and waded across, Bent following him, and in this
order they travelled.</p>

<p>So they made their way homewards, striking west
through the pathless forest, wading watercourses
and climbing and descending hills, until they emerged
on the fern country. "Ringiringi," immensely relieved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and weary beyond words, reported himself
to his chief.</p>

<p>Rupé was furiously angry when he heard the story
of the Waikato's attack on his <i>pakeha</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>kohuru</i>!" he cried, as he leaped to his feet.
"The murderer! I shall slay him this instant, on
the <i>marae</i>, though all Waikato come down to avenge
him!" And seizing an axe from the wall, he ran
out in chase of "Ringiringi's" night antagonist.</p>

<p>The old fellow, when the chief rushed out at him
like a madman, turned and fled from the village,
and ran for his life until he disappeared in the shelter
of the bush. Rupé did not pursue him far; his fit
of anger was soon spent, and he returned to his <i>wharé</i>,
and made his white man relate again, with Maori
wealth of detail, the story of the eel-fishing bivouac.</p>

<p>"Ringiringi's" would-be slayer was never heard
of again; at any rate, he did not venture back to
the camp of the Hauhaus; and whether he ever
succeeded in taking a <i>pakeha</i> head in settlement of
his <i>utu</i> bill no man knows.</p>

<p class="center">THE WAR-CHIEF AND HIS GODS</p>

<p class="blockquote">The war-chief Titokowaru&mdash;Ancient ceremonies and religion
revived&mdash;Uenuku, the god of battle&mdash;Titokowaru's <i>mana-tapu</i>&mdash;Bent
makes cartridges for the Hauhaus&mdash;A novel weapon.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1867 was one of little activity amongst
the Hauhaus with whom "Ringiringi" lived, except
in respect of their interminable meetings and <i>Niu</i>-parades
and prophesyings. Hostilities had been
suspended by both sides for the time, but the temporary
peace was only the prelude to the fiercest
fighting of the Ten-Years' War.</p>

<p>The white man worked for his master Rupé all
that year, digging and planting, carrying wood and
water, and performing, in fact, the duties of a
household slave. But it was a slavery that had
its privileges and its compensations, and there were
long days of abundant food and little work, in the
intervals between the seasons of communal labour
in the potato-fields and the periodical birding and
eeling and pig-hunting expeditions.</p>

<p>It was while living at Te Paka that "Ringiringi"
became well acquainted with the celebrated Titokowaru,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the great war-chief of the Hauhaus. Titoko,
as his name was usually abbreviated, came
riding into the little bush-village one day at the head
of an armed band of Ngati-Ruanui and Nga-Ruahiné
men, and held a meeting in the <i>marae</i>, urging the
people to renew the war. He was travelling from
village to village, haranguing the Hauhaus, and explaining
his new plan of campaign, which briefly
was to make surprise attacks on small isolated
redoubts garrisoned by the white soldiers, and to
lay ambuscades. He declared, too, that his tactics
would be, not to build any more stockaded forts in
positions where the Europeans could easily reach
them, but to entice the troops into the midst of the
forest, where the Maori warrior would have the
advantage. This scheme met with general approval,
and the tribespeople signified their intention of
joining Titoko and fighting his battles for him whenever
he gave the word to begin.</p>

<p>Titokowaru was the most brainy, as well as the
most ferocious, of the Taranaki chiefs who led the
Hauhaus against the whites. It was his strategy
that was responsible for the most serious defeats
inflicted on the Government forces in the war of
1868-9. In appearance he was a stern, commanding
man, with a countenance disfigured by the loss of
an eye&mdash;reminder of the Battle of Sentry Hill. He
was not tattooed. "When roused," says Bent,
"he had a voice like a roaring lion." In his attire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
he was often quaintly <i>pakeha</i>, for he frequently
appeared in a black "hard-hitter" hat and a full
suit of European clothing. He carried no weapon
but his sacred <i>taiaha</i>, his tongue-pointed staff of
hardwood, ornamented with a plume of red <i>kaka</i>
feathers.</p>

<p>The war-chief revived many a half-forgotten
savage practice in the campaign that followed.
Besides being a Hauhau "prophet," he was a <i>tohunga</i>,
or priest, of the ancient Maori religion.</p>

<p>Before despatching a war-party he invariably
recited the customary spells (<i>karakia</i>) to ensure
their success, and the worship, or rather placation
and invocation of Uenuku, the war-god, was resuscitated
in every armed camp and on every battle-field.</p>

<p>Titoko possessed, in a strong degree, what the
Maoris termed <i>mana-tapu</i>&mdash;personal <i>tapu</i>, or sacred
prestige, heritage from his priestly forefathers of
Ariki rank. His body was sacred in Maori eyes,
and he was accredited with many a singular supernatural
attribute: "Even the winds of heaven are
his," said the Hauhaus. When the <i>whakarua</i>, the
north-east breeze, blew, it was a fitting time for
the war-parties to set out, for the <i>whakarua</i> was the
breath of Uenuku, Titoko's deity, and his familiar
spirit, and it was an omen of success in battle.</p>

<p>Bent gives some curious instances of Titokowaru's
<i>mana-tapu</i>. Once, when the white man was travelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
through the forest with Titoko and his band
of Hauhaus, the chief's shoulder accidentally struck
against a flax kit containing some cooked potatoes
which an old man was carrying on his back. Titoko
immediately ordered the man to throw the potatoes
and basket away, for the food had become infected,
through contact with the priest, with the mysterious
and deadly microbe of the <i>tapu</i>, and consequently
unfit to be eaten. So the old fellow had to cast
his day's rations into the bushes and go fasting.</p>

<p>Titokowaru would suffer no rivals in the <i>pa</i>. Now
and then it happened during the war-days that some
budding <i>tohunga</i> would arise and prophesy things,
in bold opposition to the chief, and announce that
his familiar spirit, or his ancestral gods, had conferred
priestly powers upon him. Titoko had "a
short way with dissenters." His usual and most
effective method of silencing the pretender was to
take a basket of potatoes in his hand and seek out
his rival.</p>

<p>"What," he would say, "have you then an <i>atua</i>,
a god of your own?" Should the Hauhau be so
imprudent as to answer "Yes," Titoko would lift
his potato-kit and set it on his rival's head. "That
for your <i>atua</i>!" It was enough. The other's <i>tapu</i>&mdash;if
he ever had any&mdash;would be immediately destroyed
by such an act, for the head of man must
not be touched by food, and any self-respecting
<i>atua</i> would desert a <i>tapu</i>-less Maori without delay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
But no man dared, by way of retaliation, to try the
potato-basket trick on Titokowaru.</p>

<p>"Ringiringi" had now been nearly three years
with the Maoris, and spoke their language well.
"I lived exactly like a Maori," he says; "worked
like a nigger, and always went about bare-footed.
They would not give me a gun, nor did they make
me fight&mdash;for Titokowaru made me <i>tapu</i>, and would
not permit me to go out on the war-path&mdash;but I had
to make cartridges for them. They managed to get
plenty of gunpowder; I have often seen it brought
in in casks and in 25 lb. weights. They got a good
deal of it from the neutral and so-called 'friendly'
tribes, who procured it from the <i>pakehas</i>. The Puketapu
tribe, and some of the Whanganuis, helped us
in this way. I know there was a white man, Moffatt,
living on the Upper Wanganui River, who made a
coarse powder for the Hauhaus there, but I don't
think any of it came our way. I had a wooden
cartridge-filler, and we always had plenty of old
newspapers to make the cartridge-cases. Bullets
were plentiful, too, as a rule; but sometimes in the
bush, when the Hauhaus ran short, they would use
old iron, stones, and even pieces of hard wood. I
have sometimes loaded my cartridges with bits of
supplejack, cut to size, when I had no lead bullets."</p>

<p>In those bush-whacking days the Hauhaus made
use of some remarkable devices against their enemies.
One of these Maori engines of war was called a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
<i>tawhiti</i>, or trap. It was a sapling of some tough
and elastic timber, <i>matipo</i> for choice. When a
suitable one, about ten feet long or so, was found
growing in a likely position outside a <i>pa</i> or alongside
a bush-track by which the enemy were expected,
it would be stripped of its branches, and
bent down and back without breaking it, until it
was lying in as near as possible a horizontal position,
so that it would sweep the road. The end was
fastened with flax in such a way that any unsuspecting
person marching along the track or approaching
the village and touching the trap, would
cause the flax to slip, and release the <i>tawhiti</i>. The
tree in its rebound could inflict a terrible blow.</p>

<p>In 1866 Bent saw ten or twelve of these <i>tawhiti</i>
set on the tracks just outside Te Popoia, a small <i>pa</i>
near Keteonetea. The place was attacked by the
Government forces in the night, and in the darkness
several of the <i>Kupapas</i>, or Government Maoris,
who formed the advance guard, were injured by the
unexpected release and rebound of these savage
traps.<a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a>

<p class="blockquote">The stockade at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu&mdash;In the <i>Wharé-kura</i>&mdash;Singular
Hauhau war-rites&mdash;The "Twelve Apostles"&mdash;The enchanted
<i>taiaha</i>&mdash;The heart of the <i>pakeha</i>: a human burnt-offering&mdash;An
ambuscade and a cannibal feast.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in 1868 "Ringiringi" and his Hauhau comrades
took up their quarters in the stockaded village
of Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu ("The Beak-of-the-Bird"),
soon to be the scene of the sharpest action of the
war. This settlement was deep in the <i>rata</i> forest,
about ten miles from where the town of Hawera
now stands, in the direction of Mount Egmont.
Out on the fern-lands on the edge of the bush were
the European redoubts of Waihi and Turuturu-Mokai;
the smaller of these, Turuturu, was singled
out by Titokowaru as a position which could apparently
be easily stormed; he therefore laid his
plans to attack it, and gathered in his best fighting-men
in the forest-fort.</p>

<p>Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu was now the headquarters
of the Ngati-Ruanui and Nga-Ruahiné belligerents,
and all hands were set to work to fortify the village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and to gather in food-supplies for the <i>hapus</i> who
crowded the "Bird's-Beak" <i>pa</i>. The front of the
village faced a cleared stretch of fern-land, but the
forest surrounded it on the other sides; at the rear
ran a little creek. There were no trenches or earth-parapets;
the principal defences were stout palisades,
solid tree-trunks and split timber, eight to
ten feet high, sunk firmly in the ground, and connected
by cross-ties of saplings, fastened to the posts
with forest vines. Close to the palisades were some
great <i>rata</i>-trees, very ancient and hollow; several
of these the Hauhaus converted into miniature redoubts.
Some of the hollow trees were cunningly
loopholed for rifle-fire, and within them stagings
were made for the musketeers; rough stages, too,
were constructed up among the <i>rata</i> branches, where
the dense foliage and the interlacing boughs formed
a perfect shelter for the brown-skinned snipers.
One of the tree-platforms, just inside the <i>pa</i> walls,
was used as a <i>taumaihi</i>, or look-out tower.</p>

<p>At one end of the village was the large Hauhau
meeting-hall and praying-house called <i>Wharé-kura</i>
("House of Learning," or "Red-painted House"),
after the olden Maori sacred lodges of priestly instruction.
This building, built of sawn timber in semi-European
style, was about seventy feet in length.
It was erected by Titokowaru's working-party in
six days&mdash;in obedience to the Scriptural command
"Six days shalt thou labour"; they finished it on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the sixth day, and religiously rested on the seventh&mdash;and
for many days thereafter. The <i>Wharé-kura</i>
was consecrated by Titokowaru in the ancient
heathen fashion; it was the temple of the Hauhau
ritual, and here the high chief assembled his men
when he wished to select war-parties for assaults
and ambuscades. At the rear end of the great
house was his sacred seat and sleeping-place, laid
with finely woven flax mats and hedged by the
invisible but potent barriers of <i>tapu</i>.</p>

<p>As often happened in Maori warfare, the first
intimation the Hauhaus gave of their intention to
renew the fighting was the murder of two or three
incautious <i>pakehas</i> on the frontier.</p>

<p>Titokowaru's war-parties despatched on special
missions usually numbered sixty men. Though
consisting of this number they were termed the
<i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>, or "The Twelve."</p>

<p>This term, though applied to the whole war-party,
really belonged to the first twelve men, the advance-guard,
who were usually the most daring and active
warriors of all, but who had been selected in a peculiar
manner which will be described. These twelve were
<i>tapu</i>, and were all <i>tino toa</i>&mdash;tried and practised
fighting-men. They numbered twelve because of
the mystic force or prestige supposed to attach to
that number. Titokowaru and all his Hauhaus
were students of the <i>pakeha</i> Scriptures&mdash;Titokowaru
when a young man had been a pupil in a mission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
school&mdash;and "The Twelve" were so named and
numbered for several reasons: one was that there
were twelve Apostles in the Bible; and another
that there were the twelve sons of Jacob; then, also,
there were twelve months in the year. Clearly to
the Maori mind there was much virtue in twelve.
In Maori belief none of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> proper
could be touched by a bullet in a fight if they but
obeyed the instructions of Titokowaru.</p>

<p>Singular heathen ceremonies were practised in
the selection of these war-parties. The spirit of
ancient Maoridom was but slightly leavened by
<i>pakeha</i> innovations and missionary teachings; and
the savage gods of old New Zealand took fresh grip
on the hearts of these never-tamed forest-men.</p>

<p>"Ringiringi" on several occasions witnessed the
rites of the <i>Wharé-kura</i> what time the one-eyed
general picked out the soldiers of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>.</p>

<p>On the day before an armed expedition was to
set forth from "The Beak-of-the-Bird," Titokowaru
summoned the people by walking up and down
outside his great <i>wharé</i> chanting a song which
began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"<i>Tenei hoki au</i></div>
      <div class="verse indent-2_6"><i>Ki te Ngutu-o-te-Manu.</i>"</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="verse">("Here am I</div>
      <div class="verse indent-2_6">In the Beak of the Bird.")</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then the people would all file into the sacred house
and seat themselves on the mat-covered floor,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
fighting-men of the <i>pa</i> in front. The war-chief took
his seat cross-legged on his sacred mat that was
spread on an elevated stage at the rear of the <i>Wharé-kura</i>,
with a short rail in front; this dais was <i>tapu</i>
to him. The men all chanted together a wild <i>haka</i>
song, and then sat silent as death, waiting the will
of Titoko's war-god and the divination-by-<i>taiaha</i>.</p>

<p>The chief stood, grim and stern, facing his people,
his sacred carved hardwood <i>taiaha</i>, called "Te
Porohanga," in his hand. His wild eyes glittered
as he recited in quick, sharp tones his invocation of
the war-god Uenuku and the battle-spirit breathed
on the wings of the <i>whakarua</i> breeze. Then, balancing
his long plumed weapon in a horizontal position
on his thumb and forefinger, the tongue-shaped point
directed at the warriors, he stood stiff and motionless
as in a trance. He was awaiting the message of his
<i>atua</i>, the guiding-breath of Uenuku.</p>

<p>Suddenly, apparently of its own volition, and
without any visible movement or effort on the part
of the chief, the weapon would move. It would
slowly, slowly turn&mdash;watched with intense, breathless
earnestness by hundreds of fanatic eyes&mdash;until
its tongue pointed so as to indicate some particular
man. Ha! 'Twas the breath of Uenuku, deity
of blood and fire, that gave it its impulse; Titoko
was but the medium of the gods!</p>

  <div class="caption">THE AMBUSCADE.<br />
    <i>From a sketch by Major von Tempsky in Taranaki</i>, 1866.)</div>
</div>

<p>The warrior indicated would be questioned by
the war-chief, and asked whether his "heart was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
strong" within him. If his answer were deemed
satisfactory, he would be told off as one of the
<i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>, the sanctified advance-guard.</p>

<p>Again and again this strange method of divination
was repeated, the balanced weapon indicating&mdash;to
the perfect satisfaction of the superstitious Hauhaus&mdash;the
men whom the Maori war-god desired as the
instruments of vengeance on the whites. Name
after name the priest and chief pronounced, as his
<i>taiaha</i> pointed along the squatting ranks, until the
tale of bare-legged warriors was complete.</p>

<p>Then, when the <i>taua</i>, or war-party, had filled
their cartridge-belts and seen to their weapons,
there was a ceremony of a livelier sort. The women
and girls of the <i>pa</i> attired themselves in their waist
<i>piupiu</i> of coloured flax, decked their hair with
feathers, dabbed ochre-paint on their cheeks, and
lined up on the <i>marae</i> for the <i>poi</i>-dance, to send the
warriors off "in good heart," as the Maori has it.
<i>Hakas</i>, too, were danced by the men and boys of the
village, and the merry <i>poi</i>-songs and the loudly
yelled war-chants put a brisker jig into the feet of
the brown soldiers as they marched out of the
settlement and struck into the forest, hunting for
<i>pakehas</i>.</p>

<p>As the men of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> left the stockade,
Titokowaru himself would loudly farewell them,
shouting in his terrible gruff voice the ferocious
injunction:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Patua, kainga! Patua, kainga! E kai mau!
Kaua e tukua kia haere! Kia mau ki tou ringa.</i>"
("Kill them! Eat them! Kill them! Eat them!
Let them not escape! Hold them fast in your
hands.")</p>

<p>Should the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> meet with success in
their murderous raids, it was usual for the leader
of the party to chant in a loud voice, as the home-palisades
were neared, a song beginning, "<i>Tenei te
mea kei te mou ki toku ringa</i>," meaning that he had
in his hand a portion of the flesh of a slain <i>pakeha</i>.
This was called the <i>mawé</i>; it was an offering to the
god of war. The <i>mawé</i> was almost invariably a
human heart, torn from the body of the first man
of the enemy killed in the fight.</p>

<p>On two or three occasions Kimble Bent witnessed
the ceremony of the offering of the <i>mawé</i>, the ancient
rite of the <i>Whangai-hau</i>. The heart (<i>manawa</i>) or
other piece of human flesh, was brought into the
<i>marae</i> and given to a man named Tihirua, who was
the priest of the burnt sacrifice. He was a young
man about twenty-five years of age, belonging to
the Ngati-Maru tribe, of the Upper Waitara. "He
would take the heart in his hand," says Bent, "and
strike a match, or take a firestick and singe the flesh.
When it was slightly scorched he would throw it
away; it was <i>tapu</i> to Uenuku. This was an ancient
war-custom of the Maoris; Titokowaru adopted
it because he believed it would cause the
<i>pakehas</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to lose strength and courage, and become unnerved
in time of battle. After the fight at Papa-tihakehake,
in 1868, I saw this man Tihirua cut a white
man's body open outside the <i>marae</i>, tear out the
bleeding heart, hold lighted matches underneath
it until it was singed, and then throw it away."<a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a>
<a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>A more frightful scene still that the sun looked
down upon in that forest den was a cannibal feast.
On June 12, 1868, a party of about fifteen Hauhaus
from the <i>pa</i>, prowling out in the direction of the
Waihi redoubt, cut off and shot and tomahawked
a trooper of the Armed Constabulary, a man named
Smith, who had incautiously ventured out to look
for his horse beyond rifle-range of the redoubt.
An Armed Constabulary officer, who happened to
be walking across the parade ground at the time,
heard and saw the firing, and with his field-glasses
distinctly saw the flashing of the tomahawks as the
Hauhaus cut the man to pieces. An armed party was
immediately sent out at the double, but all they
found when they reached the spot was half the body!
The legs and hips were lying on the trampled and
blood-drenched ground amongst the fern; the head
and the upper part of the body down to the waist
had been carried off by the savages, who had
vanished into the forest as quickly as they had
come. The remains of the poor trooper were cooked
and eaten by the people in Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
after the heart had been offered to Titokowaru's
god of war by the young priest Tihirua.</p>

<p>Titokowaru, according to Bent, did not eat human
flesh himself, but a boastful letter sent by him a few
days later to a philo-<i>pakeha</i> chief at Mawhitiwhiti,
seems to indicate that he was a cannibal of the most
ferocious sort, unless, as is quite possible, he was
speaking of his people generally when he used the
first person singular. In this letter, addressed to
Puano, and dated "Wharé-kura, June 25, 1868," he
wrote this emphatic warning:</p>

<p>"Cease travelling on the roads, cease entirely
travelling on the roads that lead to Mangamanga
(Camp Waihi), lest ye be left upon the roads as food
for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the field,
or for me. Because I have eaten the white man;
he was cooked like a piece of beef in the pot. I have
begun to eat human flesh, and my throat is continually
open for the flesh of man. <i>Kua hamama
tonu toku korokoro ki te kai i te tangata.</i> I shall not
die, I shall not die. When death itself shall be dead,
I shall be alive (<i>Ka mate ano te mate, ka ora ano
ahau</i>).&mdash;From <span class="smcap">Titoko</span>."</p>

<p class="center">THE ATTACK ON TURUTURU-MOKAI REDOUBT</p>

<p class="blockquote">Hauwhenua's war-party&mdash;A night march&mdash;Attack on
Turuturu-Mokai Redoubt&mdash;A heroic defence&mdash;The heart of the
captain&mdash;Touch-and-go&mdash;Relief at last.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">One</span> biting cold evening in July, 1868, the whole
population of the "Bird's-Beak" <i>pa</i> gathered on
the <i>marae</i> to watch the departure of a fighting-column
launched by Titokowaru against the whites.
It was a night fitter for the snug <i>wharé</i> than for
the war-path, but the omens were propitious for
the expedition, and the war-god's sacred breeze, the
<i>whakarua</i>, breathed of Uenuku, blew across the
forest.</p>

<p>The sixty warriors of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> took the
trail with the lilt of the dance-girls' <i>poi</i>-chant in
their ears, and the war-choruses yelled by their
comrades in the village gritted their battle-spirit.
They were fittingly and thickly <i>tapu</i>'d for the night's
work, <i>karakia</i>'d over with many hardening and
bullet-averting <i>karakias</i>, and thoroughly Hauhau-bedevilled
for the fight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Some of the warriors, belted and painted, carried
long Enfield muzzle-loaders, some double-barrelled
guns, some stolen or captured carbines, and a variety
of other firearms. Each rifleman's equipment included
a short tomahawk thrust through his flax
girdle; a few&mdash;the storming-party&mdash;were armed
with long-handled tomahawks, murderously effective
weapons in a hand-to-hand combat. Though a
winter's night, most of them were scantily clad, as
befitted a war-party. Some wore shirts and other
part-European dress; some only flax mats and
waist-shawls.</p>

<p>Up and down the village square, as the Hauhau
captain, Hauwhenua, led his band out into the
forest, strode Titokowaru, in a blaze of fanatic
exaltation, crying his commands to the warriors.
Waving his plumed <i>taiaha</i>, he shouted, "Kill them!
Eat them! Let them not escape you!" And as
they disappeared in the darkness he returned to
his place in the great council-house, where on his
sacred mat he spent the night in commune with his
ancestral spirits and in reciting incantations for the
success of his men-at-arms.</p>

<p>In single file the Hauhau soldiers struck into the
black woods. As they entered the deeper thicknesses
of the forest, where not a star could be seen
for the density and unbroken continuity of the
roof of foliage above them, they chanted this brief
<i>karakia</i>, a charm invoking supernatural aid to clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
their forest-path of obstructions and smooth their
way:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"Wahi taratara e i</div>
      <div class="verse indent-2_6">Me tuku ki te Ariki</div>

      <div class="verse indent-2_6">Nga puke puke i noa."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Away through the bush they tramped, lightening
the march with Hauhau chants, until their objective
was neared&mdash;the little redoubt of Turuturu-Mokai.</p>

<p>One word of warning Titokowaru had given the
<i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> when he chose them for this expedition.
Kimble Bent, squatting with his fellows in
the big house, had watched the divination-by-<i>taiaha</i>
and the demon-like red tongue of the high
priest's sacred weapon turning now to one silent
warrior, now to another. He heard Titokowaru's
injunction to the chosen of the war-god:</p>

<p>"<i>Kaua e haere ki te kuwaha o te pa; kei reira
te raiana e tu ana! Ka pokanoa koutou, ka ngaua te
raiana ia koutou!</i>" ("Do not charge at the gate
way of the fort; there stands the lion! Should you
disregard this command, the lion will devour you!")</p>

<p>This caution was designed to restrain the more
impetuous of the young warriors, for Titokowaru
was a crafty general, and did not believe in wasting
good fighting-men. He had learned by dear experience
at Sentry Hill in 1864 that to dash straight
and blindly at the foe, though valiant enough, was
not always sound tactics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>The leader of the <i>taua</i>, old Hauwhenua, must have
been nearly seventy, but he was as active and agile
and keen-witted as any young man of his fighting
band. He was a product of the ferocious old cannibal
times when every tribe's hand was against its
neighbour's, and when year after year Waikato
armies besieged the stockaded holds of Taranaki.
In person he was not the ideal of a Maori warrior,
for he was short of stature, a stoutly built man, with
short grey beard and no tattoo-marks on his face.
But he had fought against Maoris and against
whites for many years of his life, and no war-captain
surpassed him in the many stratagems of bush-warfare,
and particularly in the artful laying of
ambuscades.</p>

<p>Marching with the savages of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>
was the white man&mdash;Charles Kane, or King, called
by the Maoris "Kingi," the deserter from the 18th
Royal Irish. He was armed with a gun, intending
to assist his Hauhau friends in their attack on his
fellow-whites. Kimble Bent, it was reported afterwards
in the <i>pakeha</i> camps, also accompanied the
warriors, but he denies this, asserting that he did
not stir from the <i>pa</i> all night; this is confirmed
by the Maoris. "Kingi," he says, was a fiercely
vindictive man, and swore to have a shot at the
white men from whom he had cut himself off
for ever.</p>

<p>Emerging from the forest, the warriors stole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
quietly down over the fern-slopes, and crossing the
Tawhiti creek, which wound down through a valley
close to the present town of Hawera, they worked
round to the front of the little parapeted fort that
stood in a singularly unstrategic position on a gently
rising hillside, close to the celebrated ancient <i>pa</i>,
Turuturu-Mokai. Hauwhenua passed round the
word to hide in the fern and remain in cover there
as close up to the redoubt as possible, until he yelled
the "<i>Kokiri!</i>" cry&mdash;the signal for the charge.</p>

<p>The Turuturu-Mokai redoubt was but a tiny work,
so small that the officer in charge, Captain Ross,
had to live in a <i>raupo</i> hut built outside the walls.
The entrenchment, consisting of earth-parapet and
a surrounding trench, was being strengthened by
its garrison of twenty-five Armed Constabulary, and
the work was not quite finished when the Maori
attack was delivered.</p>

<p>The night dragged on too slowly for the impatient
and shivering warriors. Some wished to rush the
white men's <i>pa</i> at once, but Hauwhenua and his
sub-chiefs forbade it till there was a little more
light. Several of the younger men began to crawl
up through the fern towards the wall of the little
fort. The form of a solitary sentry was seen,
pacing up and down outside the walls. He could
easily have been shot, but the Hauhaus waited.</p>

<p>The sentry was relieved at five o'clock in the morning.
The new sentinel was not left in peace very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
long. Five minutes after he went on duty, while he
was walking smartly up and down to keep warm, he
heard a suspicious rustle in the fern. He stopped
and peered into the dimness. Yes, he couldn't be
wrong; those dark forms crawling towards him
through the fern were Maoris! He raised his carbine
and fired, then turned and raced for the redoubt,
shouting out, "Stand to your arms, boys!"</p>

<p>The darkness&mdash;it was not yet dawn&mdash;was instantly
lit up by the blaze of a return volley, and, with a
fearful yell, the host of half-naked Maoris leaped
from the fern and rushed for the redoubt.</p>

<p>The white soldiers, roused by the firing, rushed
from their tents and manned the parapets and angles
of the work, so furiously assailed by the swarming
forest-men.</p>

<p>Captain Ross had leaped from his sleeping-place
at the first alarm. He ran out from his <i>wharé</i>,
armed with his sword and revolver, and clothed
only in his shirt. He just managed to cross the
ditch by the narrow plank-bridge ahead of the
enemy, who missed the plank in the darkness.</p>

<p>The captain quickly called for volunteers to defend
the gate.</p>

<p>"I'll make one, sir!" cried Michael Gill, an old
Imperial soldier.</p>

<p>"All right, Gill," said the captain; it was pitch
dark, but he knew Gill's voice. "Any more?"</p>

<p>Yes; they rushed for the gate&mdash;Henry McLean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
George Tuffin, Swords, Gaynor, and Gill. The others
manned the two flanking angles.</p>

<p>Private George Tuffin, one of the garrison&mdash;who is
still alive, in Wanganui&mdash;was up with the others
at the first alarm. He fired his revolver into the
mass of Maoris outside the gateway; then, dropping
the revolver, he got to work with his carbine. He
had fired one shot out of his carbine, and stooped
under the shelter of the parapet to slip in another
cartridge. Just as he was rising to fire again he
was struck in the head by a Maori bullet, and fell
to the ground unconscious. He could not have
been in that condition very long, for when he came
to, Captain Ross was still alive and fighting to keep
the Maoris out of the gateway.</p>

<p>"Hello, old man!" cried the captain; "are you
hit?"</p>

<p>Young Tuffin lay there, unable to reply.</p>

<p>"Where's your rifle?" asked the captain; he
was reloading his revolver while he spoke.</p>

<p>Tuffin pointed to where his gun was lying on the
muddy ground beside him.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys!" yelled the captain; "they're
coming in at the gate!"</p>

<p>Those were the last words Tuffin heard his commanding
officer utter. A few moments later, in
that fearful confusion of attack and defence in the
darkness, the gallant Ross was struck down, defending
the gateway to the end with his sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>A Hauhau charged right into the redoubt, and
killed the captain with his long-handled tomahawk.
Making a clean cut in his breast, he tore out the
heart, a trophy for the terrible ceremony of the
<i>mawé</i> offering. Then he darted back as quickly
as he had come, yelling a frightful cry of triumph.
And another heart was torn from a white man's
body even before it had ceased to beat. This was
the corpse of Lennon, the keeper of the store and
canteen. He had been killed alongside his little
hut, just outside the redoubt, when the fight began.
He was tomahawked almost to pieces and his heart
cut out.</p>

<p>And in the very midst of that battle in the dark
the pagan ceremony of the <i>whangai-hau</i> was performed,
the oblation to the god of war. The priest
of the war-party offered up one of the <i>pakeha</i> hearts&mdash;some
Maoris say it was Captain Ross's, although
Lennon's would really be the heart of the <i>mata-ika</i>,
the "first-fish" slain, which was usually the one
offered to the gods. The savage <i>tohunga</i> lit a match
(he carried <i>pakeha</i> matches for this dreadful purpose),
and held the bleeding heart over the flame. Immediately
it began to sizzle and smoke, he cried in
an exultant voice, "<i>Kei au a Tu!</i>" ("I have <i>Tu</i>!"),
meaning that Tu, the supreme god of war, was with
him, or on his side. Then he threw down the burnt
sacrifice, and, clutching his long-handled tomahawk,
rushed into the fight again. The captain's heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
was discovered after the fight was over lying on the
blood-stained ground outside the trench.</p>

<p>For two hours it was desperate work. The Hauhaus
charged up to the parapets, and many of them
jumped into the ditch, whence they attempted to
swarm over the walls, but were beaten off again and
again by the little garrison. The endeavour to
rush in force through the gateway of the redoubt
did not succeed. The impulsive young men, however,
disregarded Titokowaru's warning about the
"lion" in the path, and it was in this tomahawk
charge at the fort gate that most of those who were
killed fell.</p>

<p>After the captain's death Gill and McLean took
up their posts in one of the angles, and fought there
till daylight. Their Terry carbines gave them a
good deal of trouble. After a few rounds had been
fired the breech-blocks jammed, and were difficult
to open and close.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all hands did not show equal
bravery. At least four&mdash;Michael Gill says five&mdash;men
bolted for the redoubt, some of them jumping
from the parapet, soon after the fight began. Gill
called to them to stop and help to protect the
wounded. But they fled and left their comrades.</p>

<p>One of the pluckiest men in the redoubt was
Cosslett Johnston (now of Hawera), a military
settler. Mr. Johnston's intrepid example put fresh
courage into his despairing comrades on that terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
morning. Michael Gill was an old Imperial soldier;
he had served in the 57th Regiment, the old "Die-Hards"&mdash;Kimble
Bent's regiment&mdash;and his coolness
did a lot to steady his fellow-soldiers. Gill was recommended
for the Victoria Cross for his bravery,
but did not get it. He, like his comrades, certainly
deserved that decoration or the New Zealand Cross,
but did not get either.</p>

<p>When the Captain fell, Tuffin crawled, more than
half-dazed with his wound, to one of the angles.
There he received four more bullet wounds. In the
angle there were five other men; of these two were
killed.</p>

<p>Failing in their first attempt to take the redoubt
by assault, some of the Hauhaus took post on the
rising ground a little distance off, where they could
fire into the work, and one after another the defenders
dropped, shot dead or badly wounded. The ditch
was full of Maoris. Only the narrow parapet
separated them from the whites, and they yelled
at the defenders and shouted all the English "swear-words"
in their vocabulary. The <i>pakehas</i> "talked
back" at them, says one of the few survivors of
the heroic garrison, and cried "Look out! The
cavalry are coming!" but the Hauhaus only laughed
and said, "Gammon, <i>pakeha</i>&mdash;gammon!" Then,
finding that any Maori who showed his head
above the parapets was quickly shot down, they
started to dig away at the wall with their tomahawks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and succeeded in undermining the parapet
in several places. By this time half the garrison
had been shot down. One of the first killed was
Corporal Blake, who fell in one of the angles. Private
Shields, the captain's orderly, was killed in one of
the angles; Private George Holden was shot dead
behind the parapet; Gaynor was killed at the gate.
Then Sergeant McFadden fell while bravely helping
to hold an angle against the swarming enemy.</p>

<p>Private Alexander Beamish, who fell mortally
wounded while helping to defend an angle of the
fort, told his brother, John Beamish (now a resident
of Patea), who was fighting by his side, just before
he died, that he believed it was a white man who
shot him. Bent says that the deserter Kane, while
taking part in the attack, was wounded in the right
cheek by a <i>pakeha</i> bullet, and then retired from
the fight. John Beamish was struck by an Enfield
bullet and severely wounded about the time his
brother was shot, but though then unable to shoulder
his carbine, he opened packets of ammunition and
passed cartridges to Gill, the only unwounded man
in his angle of the redoubt, until the end of the
combat.</p>

<p>Here is John Beamish's story of the fight, as he
told it to me some years back:</p>

<p>"The Maoris surrounded the redoubt and tried
again and again to swarm over the wall, and they
kept it up till broad daylight. We could not see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
much at first but the flashing of guns all around us.
Presently some of the Maoris set fire to the <i>wharés</i>
outside the redoubt. They were armed with muzzle-loading
Enfields and shot-guns, and we could now
and then see the ramrods going up and down as they
rammed the charges home. Then sometimes we
would see the flash of a tomahawk and catch a
glimpse of a black head above the parapets. One
of our troubles was that there were no loopholes in
the parapets, otherwise we could have shot many
of the Maoris in the ditch. We were exposed to
the fire of the enemy on the rising ground close by,
and this was how so many of the men in our angle
were hit.</p>

<p>"Then they started to dig and cut away at the
parapets with their tomahawks. We could plainly
hear them at this work, and I heard one Maori ask
another for a match. I suppose he wanted to try
and fire our buildings inside the walls. One after
another our men dropped, shot dead or badly
wounded. I had very little hope of ever getting out
of the place alive. But we well knew what our fate
would be if the Maoris once got over the parapets,
so we just put our hearts into it and kept blazing
away as fast as we could load. We had breech-loading
carbines which had to be capped. One incident
I remember was a black head just appearing
over the parapet in the grey light, then came a body
with a bare arm gripping a long-handled tomahawk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Quietly the Hauhau raised himself up, and was just
in the act of aiming a blow at one of our men who
did not see him when we fired and brought him
down.</p>

<p>"My younger brother was fighting not far from
me. He fell mortally wounded, and before he died
he told us he believed it was a white man who shot
him. I was wounded about the same time. An
Enfield bullet struck me in the left shoulder. It
took me with a tremendous shock, just as I was
stooping down across a dead man to get some dry
ammunition. The bullet slanted down past my
shoulder-blade and came out at the back. This
incapacitated me from firing, or, at any rate, from
taking aim, so I had to content myself with passing
cartridges to Michael Gill&mdash;one of the men in my
angle&mdash;who kept steadily firing away, and with
levelling my unloaded carbine as well as I could
with my right hand whenever I saw a head bob up
above the parapet. When the fight ended Gill was
the only unwounded man in our angle of the redoubt;
out of the six who manned it when the alarm was
given, three were shot dead and two were wounded.
One man, George Tuffin, was wounded in five places.</p>

<p>"Daylight came, and those of us who could
shoulder a carbine were still firing away and wondering
whether help would ever reach us. We knew
they must have heard the firing and seen the flashes
of the guns at Waihi redoubt, only three miles away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Suddenly the Maoris ceased firing and retired into
the bush. Their sentries had given them warning
that troops were coming. As they dropped back
we rushed out of the redoubt and gave them the
last shot, and then Von Tempsky and his A.C.'s
arrived at the double, and the fight was over. My
wound kept me in the hospital for five months.
The only wonder is that any of us ever came out of
that redoubt alive."</p>

<p>The sun had risen before the fight was over. A
few minutes more and the Hauhaus would have
succeeded in undermining the parapets sufficiently
to force an entrance, and the defenders would have
fallen to the last man, and the whole of their arms
and the post-supplies have been carried off to Titokowaru's
fort in the forest.</p>

<p>The little redoubt was a frightful sight. Dead
and wounded men were lying all over the place
in pools of blood; two of them were shockingly
mutilated with tomahawks. Out of the twenty-one
defenders of the redoubt, ten were killed and five
were wounded; only six came through the fight
without a wound.</p>

<p>Hauwhenua withdrew his disappointed <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>,
carrying those of their wounded who were
unable to walk, and marched back to Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu.
The "lion" of Titoko's speech, though
sore wounded, had in truth closed his mouth on
some of their most daring braves. Takitaki, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
bold, athletic young Hauhau, who was in the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>,
was one of those who attacked Captain
Ross at the gateway. The Captain shattered Takitaki's
left arm with a bullet from his revolver before
he fell.<a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the renegade Charles Kane, or "Kingi,"
fled from the Turuturu-Mokai fight after receiving
his bullet-wound, he made his way to the Turangaréré
village, and announced that he would not

took him back to Te Ngutu, and he and Kimble
Bent were brought before Titokowaru, who was
sitting in the <i>Wharé-kura</i>. Bent now appears, from
his own account, to have wearied of his terrible life
amongst the Hauhaus.</p>

<p>The war-chief fiercely questioned "Kingi," whom
he suspected of an intention to return to the

<p>Then turning to "Ringiringi," he said:</p>

in saying that you wish to return to the white
men, it will be your death! I will kill you both
with my tomahawk, now, in this house, unless you
promise that you will never leave the Maoris! I
will slay you, and your bodies will be cooked in the
<i>hangi</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ringiringi," in real fear of his life, made answer
that he would remain with the Hauhaus if Titoko
would protect him, for he dreaded some of the chief's
fiercer followers. "Kingi," too, hastened to give
the required promise&mdash;a promise which he, unlike
his fellow-<i>pakeha</i>, broke at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>When the people had left the <i>Wharé-kura</i>, Titoko
spoke to "Ringiringi" in a more friendly and reassuring
tone, saying that he wished the <i>pakeha</i> to
remain with him in the <i>pa</i>, and that, in order to
assure his life against the wilder spirits in the tribes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
gathered under his command, he would <i>tapu</i> him,
as Te Ua had done two years before. For his <i>tapu</i>,
he explained, was a far more effective and binding
one than that of the Opunake prophet; a spell that
no man dared break on pain of death.</p>

<p>Not many days later the Irish traitor "Kingi"
deserted from the <i>pa</i>, taking with him a watch, a
revolver, and some clothing which he had "commandeered"
from the natives.</p>

<p>For some little time nothing was heard of him.
At length the warriors of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>, while out
scouting one day in the direction of Turangaréré,
discovered on the track leading to the settlement a
note addressed to the white soldiers' commander
at Waihi, stating that the writer (Kane) and Bent
were at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu, awaiting a favourable
opportunity to tomahawk Titokowaru, cut off his
head, and bring it in to the Government camp. Kane
was evidently clearing the way for his return to
civilisation, and this note&mdash;which he had left in a
spot where he hoped the white troops would come
across it&mdash;was obviously intended to serve as a
palliative in some measure of his military offences.</p>

<p>The deserter's letter was brought to the "Bird's-Beak"
<i>pa</i>, where it was translated by an English-speaking
Maori. "Ringiringi," questioned, disclaimed
any knowledge of it, and as to the incriminating
reference to himself, he assured Titokowaru
that "Kingi" was lying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Titokowaru immediately despatched the white
man and four armed Maoris after "Kingi." They
found him at Te Paka village; he disappeared that
evening, but was later caught by a party of seven
Maoris and confined in a <i>raupo</i> hut at Te Paka.</p>

<p>They killed him there that night.</p>

<p>Bent was lying half-asleep in a <i>wharé</i> in the settlement
when the seven Maoris, who had brought
"Kingi" in, entered, in an intensely excited state,
sat down, and asked him if he had heard of the
judgment on his fellow-white. Then one of them
said, "Kingi is dead."</p>

<p>Another man, leaning forward until his passionate
face almost touched Bent's, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ringi, had you done as Kingi has done, we would
not have killed you in the ordinary way. Your
fate would have been burning alive in the oven on
the <i>marae</i>!"</p>

<p>Then the seven, after a conversation between
themselves in a strange language the white man could
not understand, listen as he would&mdash;the Maoris sometimes
improvise a secret tongue, by eliding certain
syllables in words and adding new ones&mdash;the executioners
rose and left the <i>wharé</i>.</p>

<p>It was not until next day that "Ringiringi"
learned the details of the deserter's end.</p>

<p>"Kingi," after being given a meal, was left alone
in his hut, but was watched through crevices in
the wall until he sank to sleep, fatigued with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
enforced tramp. He lay with a blanket partly
drawn over his head. One of the Hauhaus, a man
named Patumutu ("The Finishing Stroke"), stole
quietly into the <i>wharé</i>, and attempted to deal him
a fatal blow with a sharp bill-hook. The blow,
however, only gashed his nose, and he leaped up
and grappled with his assailant.</p>

<p>The Maoris outside, hearing the noise of the scuffle,
rushed in. An old man&mdash;Uru-anini of the Puketapu&mdash;seized
the white man by the leg, brought him
down, and dealt him a terrible blow with an axe
as he lay on the floor.</p>

<p>The other Hauhaus completed the work with
their tomahawks, and the dead body of the renegade
Irishman, cut almost to pieces, was dragged out
and thrown into a disused potato-pit on the outskirts
of the village.</p>

<p class="center">ADVENTURES AT TE NGUTU-O-TE-MANU</p>

<p class="blockquote">In the midst of dangers&mdash;Bent stalked by Hauhaus&mdash;Old Jacob to
the rescue&mdash;"Come on if you dare!"&mdash;The white man's new Maori
name&mdash;Government forces attack and burn Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu&mdash;A new
use for hand-grenades.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bent returned to the "Bird's-Beak" stockade
he found himself in a position of extreme peril.</p>

<p>The Hauhaus, excited by the news of Kane's
treachery and summary execution, were fiercely
hostile in demeanour, and some of the young bloods
came dancing about the white man, as he walked
into the village, with menacing shouts, emphasised
by savage thigh-slapping, <i>pukana</i>-ing, and grimacing
with out-thrust tongue and rolling eyes, and similar
demonstrations of derision and hatred.</p>

<p>A council of the people was held on the <i>marae</i>,
and the killing of Kane was narrated in minutest
and barbaric detail. Then several Hauhaus rose in
turn and demanded the death of "Ringiringi," on
the principle that all <i>pakehas</i> were unreliable, and
that it was a foolish policy to keep one in the camp
who might sooner or later betray them. "Let us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
lead him outside the <i>pa</i> and shoot him," proposed
one truculent young warrior of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Kaati!</i>" cried Titokowaru, in his great roaring
voice, as he rose with his spear-staff in his hand.
"'Ringiringi' is my <i>pakeha</i>. I have <i>tapu</i>'d him,
and I have told him that his life is safe. If you
want to shoot him&mdash;well, you must kill me first!"</p>

<p>Then, turning to the white man, the war-chief
took him by the hand, led him to his own house,
and shut the people out. He told "Ringiringi"
that in the present temper of the tribesmen he had
better remain as much as he could in the <i>wharé</i>, and
that, at any rate, he must not venture far from the
door unless he, Titoko, were with him or in view.</p>

<p>Some days later, "Ringiringi," imagining from
the more settled and pacific attitude of the Hauhaus
that he no longer ran any risk in taking his walks
abroad, wandered a short distance outside the
stockade into the forest, and, seating himself on a
fallen tree-trunk, filled his pipe for a quiet smoke.
Suddenly he heard a cough. He looked about him,
but saw no one.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he called out.</p>

<p>A voice close above him replied, "It is I&mdash;Hakopa."</p>

<p>"Ringiringi" looked up quickly, and saw an old
tattooed man named Hakopa (Jacob) te Matauawa,
perched on the lowest branch of a <i>rata</i>-tree, with a
double-barrelled gun in his hand. Hakopa was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
tall, lean, straight old fellow, a veteran of the ancient
fighting type. Bent had a thorough admiration
for him as a man of singular courage, without the
braggadocio of the young <i>toas</i>; Hakopa had for a
long time exhibited a kindly leaning towards the
white man, and had been a firm friend of his all
through the troubled days in the <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick!" he said, in a low, cautious voice.
"Hide yourself, Ringi! When you walked out
of the <i>pa</i> I heard two men who were watching you
say that they would follow you up and kill you as
they had killed Kingi. They went to their <i>wharés</i>
for their weapons, and I followed you quickly to
warn you. I saw you standing there, and climbed
on this branch to see what those men are doing.
<i>E tama!</i> Conceal yourself! They are coming."</p>

<p>The white man hastily selected a hiding-place.
He lay down behind a big log near by, a fallen
<i>pukatea</i>-tree; the log and the creepers and ferns
that grew about it quite concealed him from the
view of any one approaching from the <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>Hardly had he hidden himself than two villainous-visaged
young Hauhaus walked quickly along the
track from the <i>pa</i> gateway. Both swung tomahawks
as they came, and one carried at his girdle
a revolver&mdash;trophy taken from some slain white
officer.</p>

<p>Seeing Hakopa descending from his tree-perch,
they stopped and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the <i>pakeha</i>? Did you see him pass?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" said the old man.</p>

<p>"We have come to kill him," replied one of the
men. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>Hakopa instantly put his cocked <i>tupara</i> to his
shoulder and levelled it at the foremost of the
Hauhaus, the man with the revolver.</p>

<p>"<i>Haere atu!</i>" he said sharply. "Go! Leave
this spot at once, or I will shoot you. 'Ringiringi'
is my friend."</p>

<p>The old fellow's determined air quite overawed
the <i>pakeha</i>-hunters, and they sulkily and silently
returned to the <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>Jacob watched them off, and when the white man
had risen from his hiding-place he escorted him
back to the <i>pa</i>, walking in front of him with his gun
cocked, on the alert for any attack on his protégé.
He took "Ringiringi" to his house, and then reported
the affair to Titokowaru.</p>

<p>The chief showed genuine anger. He assembled
the fighting-men, and sternly ordered them to molest
the white man no more. "If you harm him," he
said, "I shall leave the <i>pa</i> and return to my own
village. Listen! 'Ringiringi' is henceforth my
<i>moko-puna</i>&mdash;my grandchild&mdash;and I now give him
another name, the name of one of my ancestors.
His name is now Tu-nui-a-moa."</p>

<p>And behind Titokowaru leaped up old Hakopa,
a bright tomahawk in his hand. Making sharp, quick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
cuts in the air with his tomahawk, he cried, as he
danced to and fro:</p>

<p>"Yes, and if any one attempts to touch the white
man, he will have to kill me too! Kill me and Titokowaru!
Who will dare it? Come on, come on!"</p>

<p>Thereafter Bent was not molested. He went by
his new name, and "Ringiringi" he was called no
more; at any rate, not by Titokowaru's tribe.</p>

<p>The "Bird's-Beak" soon received its baptism of
blood and fire. Colonel McDonnell, with a force of
about three hundred Armed Constabulary and
volunteers, under Majors von Tempsky and Hunter,
attacked the <i>pa</i> on August 21, 1868. The whites
charged right into the village under a heavy fire,
and the Maoris fled to the bush, losing several killed.</p>

<p>Bent, fortunately for himself, was not in the <i>pa</i>;
he had gone over to the Turangaréré settlement, a
few miles away, to procure gunpowder and paper
for the manufacture of cartridges, and most of the
other men were out cattle-shooting in the bush.
Titokowaru retired to his praying-house when the
firing began, and sat there muttering incantations,
and it was only with great difficulty that he was
persuaded by his people to leave the <i>wharé</i> and
retire. The great house was set fire to by Colonel
McDonnell when the <i>pa</i> was captured, and the sacred
<i>wharé-kura</i>, where the high-priest had so often
exhorted his people and with enchanted <i>taiaha</i> told
off the warriors of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>, was soon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
mass of flames. The Government troops lost four
men killed and eight wounded in the engagement.
Most of these casualties occurred in the march back
to Waihi, which became a heavy rear-guard action,
for the main body of the Hauhaus came up in time
to attack the troops briskly as they retired through
the thick bush. Then they drew off and returned
to their half-demolished <i>pa</i>, to weep over their dead
and the ashes of their great <i>wharé-kura</i> and rebuild
their ruined homes.</p>

<p>The troops had placed a number of hand-grenades,
small shells filled with powder, in the thatch of the
<i>wharés</i> when they fired the village; but some of
the houses were not destroyed, and on the return
of the Hauhaus, they found some of these grenades
unexploded. The dangerous shells were given to
Bent to handle. He pulled out the fuses&mdash;which
the Maoris called <i>wiki</i>, or wicks&mdash;and emptied the
precious powder into flasks. In this way a sufficient
quantity of powder to make eighteen gun-cartridges
was obtained from each hand-grenade.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="center">A BATTLE IN THE FOREST; AND THE DEATH
OF VON TEMPSKY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The second fight at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu&mdash;Titokowaru's
prophecy&mdash;Tutangé and his sacred war-mat&mdash;Bent's narrow
escape&mdash;Government forces defeated&mdash;How von Tempsky fell&mdash;A
terrible retreat&mdash;Colonial soldiers' gallant rear-guard fight.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> one warm spring afternoon in 1868, when
the vast forest lay steeped in calm and Taranaki's
sentry-peak rose like a great ivory tent out of the
soft blue haze that bathed its spreading base, the
sharp, cracking sound of rifle-shots broke the quiet
of the wilderness.</p>

<p>The shots came from the mountain side of "The
Beak-of-the-Bird," the opposite one to that by
which the white troops had advanced the previous
month. Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu was being taken in
the rear this time. Colonel McDonnell had set out
from the Waihi Redoubt before daylight in the
morning, with a force of about two hundred and sixty
whites, composed of three divisions of Armed Constabulary
(many of them ex-Forest Rangers), the
newly joined Wellington Rifles and Rangers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
a few veteran volunteers, besides about a hundred
<i>Kupapas</i>, the friendly Maoris from the Whanganui
and Ngati-Apa tribes under Kepa te Rangihiwinui.
Fording the swift Wai-ngongoro River (the "Waters-of-Snoring"),
the Colonel's force, guided by the
woman Takiora, marched through the native village
of Mawhitiwhiti, which was found deserted, then
turned into the dense forest, searching for the Hauhau
stronghold, which was now reported to be at
Te Rua-ruru ("The Owl's Nest"), situated somewhere
in the rear of Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu. A disastrous
search, for it ended under the palisades of the
"Bird's-Beak," the savage beak that closed savagely
on many a gallant <i>pakeha</i> before the sun went down
in the western sea that day.</p>

<p>McDonnell had hoped by his early start to take
the Hauhaus by surprise. But wary old Titokowaru
was seldom caught napping.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>On the previous night&mdash;as the old warrior Tutangé
Waionui tells me&mdash;Titokowaru gathered all his men
in the big house (<i>wharé-kura</i>), which had now been
rebuilt. Then, when the Hauhau prayers and
chants were over, the chief arose and cried:</p>

<p>"<i>E Koro ma, kia tupato! He po kino te po, he ra
kino te ra!</i>" ("O friends, be on your guard!
This is an evil night&mdash;a night of danger, and the
morrow will be a day of danger!")</p>

<p>This oracular warning seemed to the superstitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
people to be a message from the gods, of whom Titokowaru
was the living medium. That night was a
night of preparation for battle. Armed men slipped
out along the trail in front of the stockade, and lay
in wait for the expected enemy.</p>

<p>Long the grim old chief sat on his sacred mat that
night in the <i>wharé-kura</i>, his enchanted tongue-pointed
<i>taiaha</i> lying in front of him. <i>Karakia</i> after
<i>karakia</i> he recited in a low monotone, incantations
and charms, ancient pagan and latter-day Hauhau
<i>karakia</i>, for success in the conflict that he felt was to
envelop his <i>pa</i> on the morrow in a ring of smoke and
blood.</p>

<p>In his own little thatched <i>wharé</i> that day sat
Kimble Bent, the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori. He, too, was busy,
squatting there on an old flax <i>whariki</i> mat. By his
side were a keg of gunpowder and a bag of bullets,
and in front of him a pile of old <i>pakeha</i> newspapers
and leaves torn from looted books. He was making
cartridges for the Hauhaus. Round a wooden
cartridge-filler he deftly rolled a scrap of paper,
forming a cylinder, which he tied securely with
thread or with fine strips of flax; then, withdrawing
the filler, he poured in the gunpowder. The cartridges
loaded, he slipped them into the cartouche-boxes
and holders, a number of which had been
brought to the <i>wharé</i> by the men of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>;
when the boxes were full, the remainder of
the ammunition he stored carefully in a large flax
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
basket. Most of the receptacles for the ammunition&mdash;<i>hamanu</i>
the Maoris called them&mdash;were primitive
affairs smacking of the bush. In size and shape
they resembled the ordinary military leather cartouche-boxes,
but they were simply blocks of light
wood, generally <i>pukatea</i> timber, slightly curved in
shape so as to sit well on the body when strapped,
and neatly bored with from ten to eighteen holes,
each of which held a cartridge. A flap of leather
or skin&mdash;in the earlier days it was often a piece of
tattooed human skin&mdash;covered the cartridges; and
straps of leather or of dressed and ornamented flax
were attached to the <i>hamanu</i>, which were buckled
or tied round the waist or over the shoulders. A
well-equipped fighting-man usually wore two <i>hamanu</i>,
by belts over the shoulders; and at his girdle
he carried his pouches for bullets and percussion-caps.</p>

<p>Such was the lone white man's occupation in the
forest stockade that day before the looming battle.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Next morning, after the first meal of the day had
been set before the warriors by their women and
had been quickly eaten, the war-chief came out of
his house, <i>taiaha</i> in hand, and walked out on to the
village square in front of the sacred praying-house.</p>

<p>"Friends," he cried, as he stood there on the
<i>marae</i>, "I salute you! You have eaten and are
content; for the proverb says, 'When the stomach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
is filled, then man is happy and satisfied' ('<i>Ka ki te
puku, ka ora te tangata</i>'). Now, rise up and grasp
your weapons, for I wish to see you dance the <i>haka</i>
and the <i>tutu-waewae</i> of war."</p>

<p>When the men were assembled on the parade
ground, in their dancing costume of a scanty waist-mat,
Titokowaru cried in a loud voice and prophesied,
saying:</p>

<p>"<i>Kaore e tu te ra, kaore e titaha te ra, ka tupono
tatou kia to tatou whanaunga</i>"&mdash;of which the meaning
is, "The sun will not have reached its zenith, the sun
will not have declined, before we have joined issue
with our relatives"&mdash;the white soldiers.</p>

<p>"Then," says Tutangé, "we danced our <i>haka</i> with
the fire of coming battle in our hearts, and we hardened
our nerves for the fight. For we knew that
Titoko was a true and powerful prophet (<i>poropiti
whai-mana</i>, <i>tino kaha</i>), and we believed that that
day would see blood shed again around Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu."</p>

<p>Tutangé Waionui, who was now to distinguish
himself as a daring young warrior, was but a boy.
He was not more than fifteen or sixteen years old,
but was a strong, athletic youngster, full of fire and
courage, and as agile as a monkey. He was of the
<i>momo rangatira</i>, or "blue blood" of Taranaki, tracing
a direct descent through a line of high chiefs and
priests from Turi, the great sailor who navigated his
long mat-winged canoe <i>Aotea</i> to the black iron-sand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
beach of Taranaki from the far-distant Hawaiki, the
beautiful palm-fringed island of Rangiatea (Raiatea,
as its people call it now) in the Society Group. His
father, the old warrior, Maruera Whakarewataua,
had carefully schooled him in the business of arms,
the handling of the spear-tongued <i>taiaha</i>, most
beautiful of Maori weapons, the quick and fatal use
of the tomahawk, both the terrible long-handled
one and the short hatchet, or <i>patiti</i>, as well as the
musket and shot-gun and rifle of the <i>pakeha</i>. So
here, now, was young Tutangé on his first war-path.</p>

<p>That morning, when the very air seemed full of
rumours of battle and death, Tutangé was girded
with the sacred war-mat, the <i>maro-taua</i>.</p>

and armed for the war-path as he
was in 1868.</div>
</div>

<p>"My father's sister," says he, "called me to her,
together with certain other young men who were of
<i>rangatira</i> rank, and who had not yet fought the white
man. She was a chieftainess, by name T&#257;ngamoko;
she was of <i>ariki</i> birth in the Ngati-Ruanui tribe,
and being possessed of <i>mana-tapu</i> and of a knowledge
of charms and incantations, she was as a
priestess amongst the people. She called us to her,
and told us that she was about to make us <i>tamariki
tapu</i>, that is, sacred children, for the coming battle.
She girded us each with a fine waist-garment, the
<i>korowai</i>, made of soft dressed and closely woven
white flax, with short black thrums, or cords, hanging
down it. These flax vestures, falling from our
waists to our knees, she had made herself. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
were the garments of war; she had <i>karakia</i>'d over
them and charmed them so that the bullets of the
enemy should not touch them, and so that we, their
wearers, might conquer in the fight. And very
proud and confident <i>tamariki tapu</i> we were now,
parading the <i>pa</i> in our bullet-proof <i>korowai</i>, and
dancing our weapons in the air as we leaped with
our elders in the <i>haka</i> and roared out the great
chorus of the war-song beginning, '<i>Kia kutia&mdash;au&mdash;au!</i>'
and that other one which our fathers had
chanted when first they set up the Maori Land
League, '<i>E kore Taranaki e makere atu!</i>'
('Taranaki will not be cast away from us!')</p>

<p>"One of the songs which we chanted as we wildly
danced was this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"'<i>Whakarongo ai au</i></div>
      <div class="verse indent-2_6"><i>Ki te koroki manu</i></div>

      <div class="verse">('I'm listening for the voices,</div>

      <div class="verse indent-2_6">Sounding, echoing in the forest!')</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The 'singing of the birds' was a figure of speech for
the voices of the soldiers on the march.</p>

<p>"That <i>maro-taua</i> was all the clothing I wore in
the fight. Round my brows I bound a handkerchief,
which held in place my <i>tiparé rangatira</i>, my chief-like
war-feathers. My weapons were a double-barrelled
gun (<i>tupara</i>), and a short-handled tomahawk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
which I carried stuck in my belt. Round
me I had strapped a cartridge-holder. <i>E tama!</i>
Now I was ready for my first battle."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori in this nest
of Hauhaus?</p>

<p>That morning, after he had supplied the men with
ammunition, he sat on the <i>marae</i> watching the war-dances.
The morning went, but there was no sign
from the outlying Hauhau piquets. Most of the
women and children had been sent away into the
bush at the rear of the <i>pa</i> in charge of the old chief
Te Waka-t&#257;kere-nui, in anticipation of the predicted
attack. The <i>pakeha</i>-Maori was also a non-combatant,
but he remained in the <i>pa</i> with Titokowaru
until the firing began. There were not more than
sixty fighting-men in Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu, but nearly
all of these were tried and experienced warriors,
and even those who, like young Tutangé, were still
to be blooded, were more than a match for the
average white soldier in bush-warfare.</p>

<p>It was well on in the afternoon before the first
shots were heard. The Maoris had expected attack
from the seaward or Waihi side, but to their surprise
the sound of the firing came from inland, indicating
that the troops had worked round to the rear of
"The Beak-of-the-Bird." The Maori advance-guard
of Colonel McDonnell's column had encountered
the Hauhaus in the bush and fired into
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first sharp rifle-cracks echoed through
the forest, Titokowaru went up to his <i>pakeha</i>, with
a flax kit in his hand.</p>

<p>"Friend," said the stern old captain, "take this
<i>kété</i> of mine in your charge. It contains some of my
<i>tapu</i> treasures; take great care of it, for I may not
see you again; I may fall with my tribe. Take it
and leave the <i>pa</i>, and join Te Waka-t&#257;kere-nui if
you can find his camp in the forest."</p>

<p>The white man took the carefully strapped kit
and hurried out of the stockade. Te Waka's camp,
he knew, was somewhere away in the rear; the firing
was in that direction, and he was in danger of falling
into the enemy's hands. However, he struck out
into the bush from the rear fence, expecting to steal
through the thick timber on the flank of the troops,
who, he guessed, were advancing by the track which
led in from the east.</p>

<p>He managed to elude his fellow-countrymen as
it happened, but it was "touch-and-go" with him.
Scarcely had he run out from the stockade and
entered the hollow, through which a little creek
wound through the bush at the rear of the <i>pa</i>, than
the advance-guard of the white column also reached
the creek, and crossed it to attack the <i>pa</i>. A heavy
fire was at this moment opened on the troops by the
Hauhaus, and bullets flew thick around the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori.</p>

<p>Two or three of the Armed Constabulary came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
almost upon him just as he mounted the farther
bank of the creek, near where a little burial-ground
clearing broke the continuity of the thick undergrowth;
it was here that the Hauhaus had interred
those of their number killed in the previous attack
on the <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>The Colonial soldiers must have mistaken Bent
for a Maori, for they immediately fired at him but
missed, and next moment he ducked into the jungle,
and on all-fours scrambled down into the creek bed,
where he followed down the little stream as hard as
he could go.</p>

<p>There was small wonder the A.C.'s took Bent for
a Maori, for it would have been difficult in the half-light
of that bush, at the distance of a few yards,
to have detected much resemblance to a white man
in the dark, shaggy-headed, bare-footed fellow with
an old and dirty blanket strapped around his waist,
a ragged jacket about his shoulders, and a red handkerchief
tied round his head.</p>

<p>Scrambling along, stooping low to avoid being
hit, the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori went down the creek until he
came to a large hollow <i>mahoé</i>-tree standing by the
side of the watercourse. He squeezed into the hollow
trunk of the tree, and there he remained for a few
minutes listening to the cracking of the rifles and
the loud reports of the Hauhau smooth-bores and
the yells of the combatants. Soon the firing came
nearer, and bullets began to zip through the leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and come plunk into the <i>mahoé</i>, in whose hollow
heart the white man hid.</p>

<p>"The bullets are finding me out," said Bent to
himself. "I'm in a fix still; anyhow, here goes,"
and he cautiously crept out from his place of concealment
and took to the jungle-fringed creek again.
Following down the creek, crawling, scrambling,
running, he presently began to feel his head more
secure on his shoulders, for the sound of the firing
grew fainter. He left the creek, and, striking
through the bush, found a familiar track which
led him to the little nook in the forest where old
Te Waka and the anxious women and terrified
children were camped. There he remained that
night.</p>

<p>From Te Waka's people he heard the account of
the morning's work. The Government Maori forces,
Kepa's men, came upon the camp of refugees and
killed two children; one of these, a boy of about
nine years of age, was the son of the Hauhau warrior,
K&#257;tené Tu-Whakaruru. The other child, a little
girl, they most cruelly slew by throwing her up into
the air and spitting her on a bayonet as she fell.
Another child, a little boy, was captured, but was
saved by a Whanganui Maori, who carried him out
of the forest on his back. He was a son of Te
Karere-o-Mahuru ("The Messenger of Spring").
This boy became a protégé of Sir William Fox, who
had him educated, and he is to-day a well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and gifted representative Taranaki man; his name
is Pokiha (Fox) O-Mahuru. When the camp was
surprised a woman ran away into the forest in
terror; as she was never again heard of, it is
believed that the soldiers shot her.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>For the rest of the story of that battle in the bush,
from the Maori side, my chief authorities are Tutangé
Waionui, who gave me his narrative in 1908, and
Whakawhiria, of Taranaki. Of the disaster from
the European side there are numerous accounts, no
two of which agree. The truth is, it was a lamentably
bungled affair, redeemed by numerous acts of
personal heroism, and particularly by the gallant
rear-guard action fought by a portion of the column
under the brave young Captain Roberts during the
terrible retreat which followed the repulse of the
troops.</p>

<p>The Government force outnumbered the Hauhaus
in the <i>pa</i> by more than five to one. Of this, however,
McDonnell and his officers and men were
ignorant, otherwise there might have been a very
different story to tell. In the obscurity of the
dense bush, where the savage forest-men were in
their familiar haunts, everything was strange and
terrible to the recruits, and the imagination magnified
the numbers of the foe, who poured bullets from
their well-masked fastnesses.</p>

<p>Yet many of the whites were old and seasoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
bushmen, who had served in the Forest Rangers
and other corps; they had carried their carbines
on many a dangerous forest trail, and fought the
Hauhaus again and again, and they were led by
officers of ability, coolness, and bravery. Under
McDonnell there was, for one, that soldier of fortune,
Major Gustavus von Tempsky, most picturesque of
guerilla fighters, the central figure in many stories
of daring and adventure, the adored of his bush-whackers
and the terror of the Maoris.</p>

  <div class="caption">MAJOR VON TEMPSKY<br />
    (<i>From a photo, 1865.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>"Wawahi-waka," the Waikato Maoris called him&mdash;"The
Splitter-of-Canoes"&mdash;because of his exploits
in war. "Manu-rau"&mdash;"Hundred Birds"&mdash;was
the name by which he was known amongst the
Taranaki Hauhaus. The name had been given him
because of his activity in rushing from place to
place, fighting here and fighting there, as swiftly
as the forest-birds that flitted from tree to tree.
Every Maori knew of "Manu-rau," and many of
those in arms had been chased by him at one time
or another during the three years of war since he
led his Forest Rangers to the assault at Otapawa
stockade.</p>

<p>Von Tempsky was of aristocratic Polish blood.
He had begun soldiering life as a Prussian chasseur,
had served under the unfortunate Emperor Maximilian
in Mexico, and fought in several little wars
in Central America; had been a gold-digger on the
great tented fields of Victoria and the Hauraki;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
he was a clever artist in water-colours and a good
miniature painter, and he had written a book of
travels in Mexico, "Mitla," illustrated with his own
sketches. In the Waikato War he and Captain
William Jackson had led their Forest Rangers in
several sharp skirmishes, and in Taranaki he was
in the thick of the bush-fighting, and had tramped
with his veterans through the forest in General
Chute's great march from Ketemarae northwards
to Mataitawa and New Plymouth, round the back
of the Mountain.<a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a>
<a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>He was a good shot, a finished swordsman, and
could throw a bowie-knife with deadly accuracy.
It was in Mexico that he learned the use of the
knife, and he never tired of impressing on his men
its advantages in bush fighting.</p>

<p>Swarthy of visage, with long, black, curling hair,
upon which a forage cap was cocked at a defiant
angle, his grey flannel shirt carelessly open at the
neck, his trousers tucked into long boots that came
nearly up to his knees, a bowie-knife in a sheath
and a revolver at his belt, a naked sword, long and
curved, in his hand&mdash;this was von Tempsky on the
war-path, a picturesquely brigand-like figure, upon
whom the soldiers' eyes rested with wonder and a
good deal of admiration.</p>

<p>Of that disastrous attack on "The Beak-of-the-Bird"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
stockade many accounts have been given,
but the many discrepancies in detail that an examination
of each account reveals are hardly to be wondered
at, considering the confusion and misunderstandings
that arose and that largely wrought the
defeat of Colonel McDonnell's column. The dense
and roadless forest, with its intricacies of undergrowth
and interlacings of supplejack, and the
inequalities of the ground made it difficult for the
Colonial soldiers to keep in touch with each other,
and the extraordinary activity and mobility of their
savage assailants, who were perfectly at home in
their jungly woods, more than compensated for
the difference in numbers. The forest trees were the
Hauhau redoubts. Amongst these trees, their naked
brown skins nearly blending in colour with the
trunks, they were almost invisible, and in most
cases only the puffs of smoke, or brown arms moving
up and down using the ramrods, indicated their
lurking places. They darted from one cover to
another with the quickness of monkeys, and though
their weapons were mostly muzzle-loading smooth-bores,
they managed to fire and reload with astonishing
celerity. Too many of McDonnell's force were
newly joined, raw young fellows, who now for the
first time met the Maori warrior in the bush, and
the hidden foe, with their merciless fire and their
terrible yells of hate and defiance, struck terror to
many a recruit's heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the large <i>rata</i> and <i>pukatea</i> trees growing
close to the stockade were hollow, and in several
of these the Maoris had cut loopholes, which they
used for musketry fire. Some of the trees, too, spat
leaden death. Brown figures flitted like forest-demons
from cover to cover. At these and at the
naked arms and shaggy heads that showed themselves
for a moment the coolest and best shots of
the Constabulary sent their bullets, and every now
and then a Hauhau came crashing to the ground;
but for every Maori that was hit five white men
fell.</p>

<p>The forest rang with the sharp cracking of the
rifles and the bang-banging of the heavily charged
muzzle-loaders, and within the stockade the women
that remained encouraged their warriors with shrill
yells.</p>

<p>"Kill them! Eat them!" they screamed, as
they waved their shawls and mats. "Fight on,
fight on! Let not one escape!"</p>

<p>White men dropped quickly, wounded or shot
dead. McDonnell evidently over-estimated the
strength of the enemy, for he concluded that it
would be impossible to rush the <i>pa</i> or to hold it if
it was successfully rushed, for the enemy were now
all round him. Had he only known the real state
of affairs, that there were barely sixty armed Hauhaus,
of whom only about twenty remained within
the stockade, the story of Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
have been far less saddening, at any rate to the
<i>pakeha</i>.</p>

<p>McDonnell, considering the position too strong
to be carried by assault, determined to strike out
to the left through the forest and retire. Von
Tempsky and Major Hunter pleaded with him to
let them charge the stockade, but the Colonel would
not consent, and presently ordered the retreat.
Moving off, he sent a message to von Tempsky
telling him to collect his men and form a rear-guard.
He sent the wounded on with Major Hunter and
Captain Newland, and followed with about eighty
men, cutting a way through the undergrowth.</p>

<p>Von Tempsky remained, angry and disgusted at
being refused permission to storm the <i>pa</i>, but too
good a soldier to disobey orders. With him were
most of the men of his two Armed Constabulary
Divisions, No. 2 and No. 5, with Sub-Inspectors
(Captains) Brown and J. M. Roberts, a few Patea
Rifle Volunteers under Captain Palmer, the Wellington
Rangers under Lieutenants Hastings and
Hunter, and about twenty-five Taranaki Volunteers
under Lieutenant Rowan.</p>

<p>Sword in hand, von Tempsky moved restlessly to
and fro, regardless of the bullets that hummed about
him. He ordered those nearest him to take cover
but himself remained erect, angrily cutting at the
undergrowth with his sword. And there he was
when a Hauhau bullet found him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I will let the Maoris tell their story of how
von Tempsky and his comrades fell. Tutangé
Waionui says:</p>

<p>"When the attack on our <i>pa</i> began, two or three
of us, including Hotu and Tihirua, climbed up on
an old partly hollow <i>rata</i>-tree that grew in a slanting
position near the centre of the stockade, in order
to see whether it would be a good place from which
to fire at the <i>pakehas</i>. A little way up it forked
into two large branches, and it was from this fork
that we intended to fire. However, we found that
it did not suit us, as we could not see anything of
the soldiers who were hidden in the thick bush outside
the stockade, so we rushed out into the forest,
seeking our enemy.</p>

<p>"There were two large <i>rata</i>-trees outside the
stockade, but the statement made that von Tempsky
was shot from a <i>rata</i> is incorrect. I have seen a
picture which purports to show him being shot down
by a Maori perched in a tree. This is altogether
contrary to fact, as I will explain to you.</p>

<p>"When we rushed out to the rear of the <i>pa</i> the
soldiers were rapidly approaching the stockade.
We crouched down amongst the undergrowth, close
to the little creek, and directed our shots at the
thicket which grew between the <i>pa</i> and the creek.
Some of the soldiers, crossing the creek, were in this
part of the bush, and soon I saw Manu-rau (von
Tempsky). Heavy firing was going on all this time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and many white men had fallen. Presently many
of the soldiers withdrew, carrying their wounded,
but Manu-rau remained with his men, his drawn
sword in his hand&mdash;the long curved sword which
had already become famous amongst the Maoris.
He came out into clear view of us, within a very
short distance of where we were crouching&mdash;I should
say less than half a chain. I fired with the others.
One of our bullets struck him&mdash;I have always believed
it was mine. One of his fellow-soldiers, who
was close by, ran to pick him up, and he too fell,
shot by one of my companions. Others ran out to
rescue the fallen <i>pakehas</i>, and they were shot down
by us and by the other Maoris, until soon there were
nine white men lying dead or wounded around
Manu-rau.</p>

<p>"When the Government forces had fallen back
before a <i>kokiri</i>, a charge, led by K&#257;tené Tu-Whakaruru,
the Hauhau leader and scout, I ran out to
where Manu-rau was lying dying on the ground.
He seemed to be still living when I reached him.
I snatched out my tomahawk from my girdle and
dealt him a cut with it on the temple, to make sure
of him, and killed him instantly. Then I took from
him his uniform cap, his revolver and sword, and a
lever watch which he had in his pocket.</p>

<p>"The sword, revolver, watch, and cap which I
took from the soldier-chief's body I carried into the
<i>pa</i> and laid before our war-chief Titokowaru. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
was one of the rules observed by Titokowaru's war-parties;
the spoils of war must be taken to the chief
for division. I was given the revolver, and used
it afterwards in the war.</p>

<p>"That is the story of how von Tempsky was
killed. I hope you will, when the opportunity
comes, tell the <i>pakehas</i> that the picture which represents
Manu-rau as being shot by a Maori who
was perched up in a <i>rata</i>-tree is not correct. You
<i>pakehas</i> will not regard my action in tomahawking
Manu-rau as a <i>kohuru</i>, a murder? Well, then, as
you say, it was in the course of war, and it was quite
<i>tika</i> and correct. I was but a very young man then,
just a boy, and it was my first battle."</p>

<p>By the side of this I will put Whakawhiria's
account. Whakawhiria lives at the big native
village of Parihaka, the old-time town of the prophets
Te Whiti and Tohu. His narrative was given in
May, 1909, to the Rev. T. G. Hammond, of Opunake,
Wesleyan missionary to the Taranaki Maoris, who
has sent it on to me to supplement the other versions
of the fight. Whakawhiria's story is generally
accepted as authentic by the Taranaki Maoris;
most of the survivors of the fight agree that it was
his father Te Rangi-hina-kau, as he says, who shot
von Tempsky.</p>

<p>Whakawhiria was a young man of eighteen or so
at the time of this engagement, but though so young
he was already a veteran on the war-path. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
seen the smoke of battle in 1860, at Waireka, when
the Taranaki settlers, for the first time met the
Maori on the field of war.</p>

<p>His estimate of the strength of the garrison in
Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu is even lower than Tutangé's,
for he says there were not more than forty-five
fighting men in the <i>pa</i> when it was attacked.</p>

<p>Te Rangi-hina-kau, Whakawhiria, and a party of
others sallied out from the stockade and met their
enemy skirmishing in the bush. In the rear of the
<i>pa</i> ran a little stream, the Mangotahi. On the
banks of the creek the eight Hauhaus took cover,
Whakawhiria and his nearest companions crouching
under a <i>karaka</i>-tree, and it was from that point that
they shot von Tempsky and his men. The eight
warriors were Te Rangi-hina-kau, Whakawhiria,
Ika-wharau, Tutangé Waionui, Te Whau, Heheu,
Umu-umu and Wairau. They fired at von Tempsky
at very close range, not more than twenty paces,
just across the little creek.</p>

<p>"It was Te Rangi-hina-kau who shot von
Tempsky," said Whakawhiria. "He dropped on
one knee, and, taking careful aim, fired and shot
von Tempsky. He shot him through the head,
and afterwards cut out his heart as an offering to
the Maori war-gods." (Kimble Bent's and
Tutangé's versions given me contradict this.)
"Young Tutangé," continued Whakawhiria, "acted
a very brave part, but it was not he who actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
shot the major. Tutangé obtained von Tempsky's
watch as his share of the loot, and Whakawhiria
got his gun and pistol."</p>

<p>During the engagement Titokowaru remained in
the <i>pa</i>, shouting to his men, urging them to continue
firing, and yelling such battle-cries as "<i>Whakawhiria</i>!
<i>Whakawhiria</i>!" ("Twist them round
and round!" or "Encircle them!") It was from
this circumstance that the warrior Whakawhiria
assumed his present name.<a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a>
<a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>On von Tempsky's fall, Captain J. M. Roberts,
a cool and gallant young Constabulary officer,
ordered his bugler to sound the "Halt" and the
"Officers' Call," and tried to form the rear-guard
into some order. Collecting as many of the wounded
as he could, he began his retreat through that
terrible death-haunted forest.</p>

<p>All through the fighting Titokowaru remained
within the stockade, directing the defence and
reciting incantations and chanting sacred <i>waiatas</i>
to his gods for success in the fight. With him was
the priestess Tangamoko, the woman who had that
morning garbed the young warrior Tutangé with the
sacred war-mat.</p>

<p>When von Tempsky fell and the retreat of the
survivors began, Titokowaru ordered a <i>kokiri</i>, or
charge, in pursuit, which, as Tutangé has mentioned,
was led by the warrior K&#257;tené Tu-Whakaruru.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Those of the Hauhaus who were in or near the stockade
gathered under K&#257;tené and danced in their
ferocious joy a dance of victory, and this is the
<i>ngeri</i> (war-song) they shouted all together as they
leaped in that terrifying <i>tutu-waewae</i>:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The puffy clouds of smoke now drew away from
the <i>pa</i>, as the Hauhaus followed their defeated foes
into the dark forest. With appalling yells they
rushed at their white enemies, tomahawking those
who had fallen to make sure of them, as Tutangé had
done with von Tempsky.</p>

</div>

<p>"<i>Ka horo! Ka horo!</i>" they yelled. "They
are beaten!" And thrusting their bloody tomahawks
into their belts they recharged their guns,
and, leaping from tree to tree, fired heavily and
incessantly at the gallant little rear-guard who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
struggling through the tangled bush, caps gone,
uniforms torn, nearly every man either wounded
or blood-stained from his comrades' wounds.</p>

<p>The sun had just set. The ghostly tree-shadows
lengthened, and it was already dark in the deeper
thicknesses of the bush.</p>

<p>Just after the retreat commenced one of Captain
Roberts' steadiest men, Corporal Russell, dropped
his carbine and fell; a big-calibre bullet had
smashed his thigh-bone.</p>

<p>"Shoot me, boys&mdash;shoot me!" he begged his
comrades. "Don't leave me to be tomahawked."</p>

<p>He knew as well as they did that his smashed
leg meant death. The rear-guard was already
encumbered with wounded and could carry no more.</p>

<p>"No, we can't shoot you, old man," said a big,
tall volunteer sergeant, who was a tower of strength
to Roberts' little band, shooting with deadly aim
from his post in the rear of the retreat. "Take
this," and he shoved into the wounded man's hand
a loaded revolver.</p>

<p>Then the sergeant (James Livingston) picked up
the corporal's empty carbine, and swinging it by
the barrel, hot with much firing, smashed it against
a tree-butt. "Old Tito'll never use that gun,
anyhow," he said.</p>

<p>Bursting from the trees, the brown, nearly naked
savages came yelling at the rear-guard. Hastily
slipping fresh cartridges into their carbines, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
gigantic volunteer and his comrades sent a volley
at the enemy. It was taking <i>utu</i> for the corporal
in anticipation. Then they sorrowfully turned and
went on into the dusky forest, leaving their comrade
stretched there on the mossy ground, gazing stern-mouthed,
unflinchingly down the way of death.</p>

<p>Out from the ferns and supplejack leaped the
foremost of the Hauhaus, a tattooed, blanket-girded
man, with wild eyes rolling in blood-madness. His
double-barrelled gun he had shifted from his right
hand to his left, and he drew his shining tomahawk
from his flax belt.</p>

<p>With an ear-ripping cry and the bound of a tiger
he came on, hatchet in air.</p>

<p>The corporal stiffened his back, levelled his revolver,
and fired.</p>

<p>The Maori fell, and lay with his face touching the
soldier's boot.</p>

<p>A yell of "<i>Patua! Patua!</i>" came from the
trees, and more bare figures with crossed cartridge-belts
came rushing on, war-axe in hand.</p>

<p>Gripping his revolver hard, his trigger-finger
steady, the corporal fired again, and another of his
foes fell.</p>

<p>Now they stood off and shot the brave corporal
dead, and so, after all, he died like a soldier and not
under the frightful tomahawk.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>McDonnell's column, the stronger one, was in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
meantime fighting its way out through the forest to
the Wai-ngongoro, hard beset by the Hauhaus, who
had by this time been reinforced by others from the
nearest villages. The Maoris followed closely in the
rear and kept up a heavy fire, to which McDonnell and
his officers and men could only return occasionally;
their ammunition was getting very short. With
McDonnell marched a French Roman Catholic priest,
Father Jean Baptiste Rolland, the <i>padre</i> of the
forces, who had been described only a few weeks
before, in a letter written by von Tempsky, as "a
man without fear." Whenever a soldier fell, whether
he was Catholic or Protestant, the kind-faced father
was by his side in a moment, tending his wounds, and,
if dying, soothing his last moments with a prayer.
He took his turn, too, at carrying the wounded.</p>

<p>Three holes, drilled by Hauhau bullets, ornamented
the <i>padre's</i> old wide-brimmed soft felt hat when
he reached the Waihi camp that night.</p>

<p>It was just dark when the snoring Wai-ngongoro
was reached, and the bridgeless river, running high
and swiftly, was forded with some difficulty under
fire. At ten o'clock at night the redoubt was reached,
and here it was found that a mixed party of fugitives
from the battle-field, numbering about eighty
Europeans besides the <i>Kupapas</i>, had already
arrived, and had reported all the officers, McDonnell
included, killed or wounded and left on the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>And how fared Captain Roberts' little rear-guard
of sixty men?</p>

<p>Extending his force in skirmishing order, the
young officer pushed on as well as he could, carrying
his wounded&mdash;one in every six. When darkness
came on he halted, for it was hopeless to try to
force a way through the jungle-matted woods in
the blackness of the night. It was a cold frosty
night, and the wounded were in agonies of pain,
which their distressed comrades were helpless to
relieve. There on the damp and freezing ground
they crouched till the moon rose at two o'clock in the
morning. Now, guided by five brave fellows of the
Maori contingent, Whanganui and Ngati-Apa men,
who stood by Roberts and his wounded to the last,
the rear-guard recommenced the retreat. Struggling
wearily on through the tangling <i>kareao</i> and the
densely growing shrubs, stumbling over logs and
splashing through little watercourses, they emerged
at last thankfully on to the open country, and soon,
bearing their wounded and dying comrades across
the dark flooded Wai-ngongoro, were greeted by
the joyful cheers of their comrades, European and
Maori, under Kepa te Rangihiwinui, who had set out
from the Waihi Redoubt to their rescue when
daylight broke.</p>

<p>Only then was the full story of the repulse pieced
together&mdash;a story of a fight that in point of numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
was only a skirmish, as battles go, but that was the
most serious set-back the white man had yet suffered
at the hands of the brown warriors of the Taranaki
bush. Of the twenty-four whites killed five were
officers, men who could badly be spared in that
frontier warfare. The wounded numbered twenty-six,
whose rescue from the tomahawks of the Hauhau
was carried out in a way truly heroic.</p>

<p class="center">THE CANNIBALS OF THE BUSH</p>

<p class="blockquote">After the battle&mdash;The slain heroes of Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu&mdash;A
terrible scene on the <i>marae</i>&mdash;What Bent saw from his
prison-hut&mdash;The sword of "Manu-rau"&mdash;A funeral pyre&mdash;Priestly
incantations&mdash;A soldier's body eaten&mdash;Why the Hauhaus became
cannibals.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning after the battle, Kimble Bent and
his companions, who had been informed by a messenger
the previous night of the result of the forest
engagement, hurried back to the stockade.</p>

<p>The news of the repulse of the white troops had
spread with incredible swiftness all over the Maori
country-side, and the Hauhaus from the neighbouring
villages gathered in Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu to hear
the story of the fight and to share in the distribution
of the loot taken on the battle-field.</p>

<p>The village was crowded with Hauhaus, all in a
fearful state of excitement, a delirium of triumphant
savagery.</p>

<p>Yelling like furies, shouting ferocious battle-songs,
waving their weapons in the air, the victorious
warriors were there with their spoils&mdash;carbines,
swords, revolvers, soldiers' caps and belts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>More frightful still was the sight of which Bent
had just a glimpse as he entered the gateway of the
<i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>Laid out in a low row in the centre of the <i>marae</i>,
side by side, were bodies of many white soldiers,
nearly twenty of them, all stripped naked&mdash;the
fallen heroes of Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu.</p>

<p>Just a glimpse the white man had as he entered
the blood-stained square. The next moment he
was surrounded by a howling mob of Hauhaus,
grinning, yelling, laughing fiendishly, shaking their
weapons in his face, all in sheer hate and contempt
of anything with a white skin.</p>

<p>Two or three of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> men whom
Bent knew came bounding up. One of them said
to him:</p>

<p>"Tu-nui, you must come with me. It is Titoko's
command." The Maori led Bent to a small thatched
hut on one side of the <i>marae</i>. Here he shut the
white man in, and fastened the low sliding-door on
the outside.</p>

<p>For a little while the white man sat in the gloom
of the windowless <i>wharé</i>, listening to the demoniac
shouts of the Hauhaus outside, and wondering
what would come next&mdash;whether, indeed, his own
body would not soon be added to the terrible pile of
slain soldiers on the <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>At last, hearing Titokowaru's great voice raised in
commanding tones, Bent's mingled curiosity and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
fear impelled him to search for a loophole from
which he could see what was going on.</p>

<p>Discovering a small crack in the reed-thatched
walls of the hut, he enlarged it sufficiently to gain
a good view of the assemblage on the village square.</p>

<p>There they squatted, men, women, and children,
their faces smudged with charcoal or with red ochre,
the paint of the war-path. They were seated on
the ground in a great half-circle, facing the staring
white corpses of the slain <i>pakehas</i>. The frightful
clamour of the savages had given place with strange
suddenness to a dead silence, as they listened to
their war-chief's harangue, and watched him pacing
quickly to and fro, with his sacred <i>taiaha</i> in his hand,
now carrying it at the trail in the <i>taki</i> attitude, now
dandling it high in the air as he intoned a chant to
his battle-god Uenuku.</p>

<p>"Bring out my <i>pakeha</i> Tu-nui-a-moa!" cried
Titokowaru, when he had ended his speech.</p>

<p>A Maori rose, and, unfastening the <i>wharé</i> door,
led Bent out on to the assembly-ground.</p>

<p>He was taken up to the corpses of the slain
soldiers, and one of the Hauhau chiefs asked him
if he knew any of them.</p>

<p>Bent walked slowly past the dead, scrutinising
each body carefully. He recognised two of them.
One was an old soldier who had been a comrade of
his in the 57th Regiment, and who had afterwards
joined the Colonial forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The other dead soldier he identified was von
Tempsky. The major's body lay there naked, with
a deep tomahawk cut on the right temple, and the
long, curly black hair matted with blood. The other
bodies were hacked about the head with tomahawks;
this was the work of the Maori women, who delighted
in mutilating the dead in revenge for those
of their relatives who had fallen.</p>

<p>Before announcing his recognition of the white
warrior's remains, he turned to the people and asked
if any of them had taken from a <i>pakeha</i> officer a
sword with an unusual curve in it, and a cap bound
with a brass band.</p>

<p>A Hauhau jumped up and said, "Yes, I have
them."</p>

<p>"Show me which soldier you took them from,"
said Bent.</p>

<p>The Maori, with von Tempsky's sword in his hand,
pointed to the major's corpse.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bent, "that is the body of Manu-rau,
whom the <i>pakehas</i> called von Tempsky, and that
is his sword."</p>

<p>A great "Ah-h" came from the people, and the
exultant possessor of Manu-rau's sword of wondrous
<i>mana</i> went bounding down the <i>marae</i>, flashing the
weapon above his head, turning his painted face
from side to side in the hideous grimaces of the
<i>pukana</i>, and thrusting out his tongue to an extraordinary
length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hauhaus were in a frenzy of excitement when
they realised that the renowned Manu-rau was indeed
lying dead before them. Some of them proposed
to drag the body out and cook it in the <i>hangi</i>,
so that they might have the satisfaction of devouring
their most dreaded enemy, and eating his heart, the
heart of a <i>tino-toa</i>, a warrior indeed.</p>

<p>But Titokowaru, raising his sacred spear-staff,
forbade the handling of the dead for the present.</p>

<p>Bent was now ordered to return to his hut, and
the door was again fastened on him. The proposal
to cook and eat the bodies of von Tempsky and his
comrades was debated in a wild <i>korero</i>. Bent, from
his eye-hole in the wall of the <i>wharé</i>, saw Hauhau
after Hauhau, the orators of the tribes, jump up,
tomahawk or gun or sword in hand, and furiously
declaim as they went leaping and trotting backward
and forward in the open space between the ranks
of the victors and the dead; and the deeds of the
battle-field were told again and again in great boasting
words.</p>

<p>Von Tempsky's body, the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori had
observed while on the <i>marae</i>, had not been mutilated,
except for that tomahawk cut. His heart had not
been cut out, though Bent half expected it would
have been. The rite of the <i>Whangai-hau</i>, the ceremony
of propitiation and burnt sacrifice following
a battle, had not, however, been omitted. On the
previous night, Tihirua, the young war-priest, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
cut open a soldier's body and had torn out the
heart, which he had offered in smoke and fire as
oblation to Uenuku, the God of War, chanting a
<i>karakia</i> as he watched the heart of the hated white
man smoking in the flames.</p>

<p>"Manu-rau's" famous sword, too, was set apart
as a sacred gift to the gods; it was a <i>parakia</i>, or
<i>taumahatanga</i>, a thank-offering for victory. It
became a <i>tapu</i> relic, and was religiously preserved
by the Hauhaus. It is in their possession to this
day.</p>

<p>Presently the bodies of the slain&mdash;the "Fish-of-Tu"&mdash;were
ceremoniously apportioned amongst
the several tribes represented in the village, as Bent
again watched from his eye-hole in the wall.</p>

<p>One of the chiefs paced up and down past the pile
of dead, with a stick in his hand. Pointing to a
soldier's corpse, he cried:</p>

<p>"This is for Taranaki! Take it away!"</p>

<p>Pointing to the others, he said:</p>

<p>"This is for Ngati-Ruanui&mdash;take it away! This
is for Nga-Rauru&mdash;take it away"&mdash;and so on until
the whole of the dead men had been portioned out
to the Hauhau clans to deal with as they deemed
fit&mdash;subject always, however, to Titokowaru's approval.</p>

<p>The Nga-Rauru, the wild tribe of the Waitotara
River, were the only men who actually took a body
from the line of dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Two warriors jumped up and, laying their weapons
aside, seized a dead soldier by the ankles and dragged
the corpse away. One was Wairau, the other was
the celebrated scout K&#257;tené Tu-Whakaruru. This
K&#257;tené was a strange fellow. He had fought for
some time on the Government side against his own
countrymen, then he suddenly reverted to Hauhauism
and barbarism, and led his warriors against
his old friends and commanding officers, McDonnell
and Gudgeon, with utter valour and ferocity. Now
he was to turn cannibal.</p>

<p>K&#257;tené and his companion dragged the body
along the ground across the <i>marae</i> to the cooking-ovens
in the rear of the dwelling-huts, watched in
silence by the people. "I could not say whose
body it was," says Bent, "but it was a man in good
flesh!"</p>

<p>When the two Hauhaus had hauled their body
away to the <i>hangi</i> for a terrible feast, the tribes sat
in silence for a few moments, gazing intently on
their dead enemies lying there before them. It was
a calm, windless day, and the midday sun beat hotly
down on that ghastly pile in the middle of the
crowded <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>Titokowaru rose, <i>taiaha</i> in hand. In his great
croaking voice he cried:</p>

<p>"<i>E koro ma, e kui ma, tena ra koutou! Tanumia
te hunga tapu, e takoto nei; e tahu ki te ahi. Kaore
e pai kia takoto ki runga ki te kino. Te mea pai me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
tahu ki te ahi!</i>" ("Oh, friends, men and women&mdash;I
salute you! Bury the sacred bodies of the slain,
lying before us here. And burn them with fire! It
is not well that they should be left to offend. They
must be consumed in fire!")</p>

<p>At this command the people dispersed to collect
fuel for a funeral pyre. They brought logs and
branches of dry <i>tawa</i> timber from the surrounding
bush and from the firewood piles in the rear of
the <i>wharés</i>, and a huge pile of wood was built in
the centre of the <i>marae</i>. Even the little naked
children came running up with their little hands
full of sticks to cast upon the heap.</p>

<p>All the mutilated bodies of the white soldiers&mdash;except
the one that had been dragged away&mdash;were
lifted up and placed on the roughly levelled top
of the pyre, which was about four feet high and
about fifteen feet long.</p>

<p>Titokowaru ordered his men to place von Tempsky's
body on the fire-pile first, and then lay the
others on top of it. The chief suspected, perhaps,
that some of the Hauhaus wished to cook and eat
Manu-rau's body, and he so far respected his
gallant foeman even in death that he resolved to
spare it that last degradation.</p>

<p>So the major's body went on first, and then
around and above it were heaped the other soldiers.
On top of the bodies more wood was thrown.</p>

<p>Bent's hut door was now unfastened, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
natives called to him to come out. What he saw
he will tell in his own words:</p>

<p>"When I walked out on to the <i>marae</i>, I met two
Nga-Rauru men I knew from Hukatéré village, on
the Patea River. They had come to Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu
with a gift of gunpowder to Titokowaru.
With them I presently went down to the cooking-quarters
to see what had become of the body that
had been dragged away. There we found a large
earth-oven full of red-hot stones, and there they
were engaged in roasting the white man's corpse.
They had prepared it for cooking in the usual way,
and were turning it over and over on the hot stones,
scraping off the outer skin.</p>

<p>"The cannibal cooks looked round and asked me
savagely what I wanted there. They threatened
that if I did not leave instantly they would throw
me into the oven too, and roast me alive.</p>

<p>"I returned to the <i>marae</i>, and was sitting amongst
the crowd there some time later, perhaps an hour,
when I saw a man's hands and ribs, cooked, carried
up. The human flesh was placed in front of the
two powder-carriers from Hukatéré, who were
sitting close to me. The meat was in a flax basket,
and a basket of cooked potatoes was set down with
it. This present of food was out of compliment to
the visitors.</p>

<p>"The two Maoris refused to touch it, saying, 'No,
we will not eat man!' So the other natives ate it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
The rest of the body was also served round, and the
people consumed the whole of it.</p>

<p>"K&#257;tené and Wairau were two of those who ate
the cooked soldier. I saw K&#257;tené squatting there,
with a basket of this man-meat and some potatoes
before him. He took up a cooked hand, and before
eating it sucked up the <i>hinu</i>, or fat, that was collected
in the palm just as if he were drinking
water. The hands when cooked curled up with the
fingers half-closed, and the hollowed palm was
filled with the melted <i>hinu</i>.</p>

<p>"Titokowaru did not eat human flesh himself.
His reason for abstaining was that if he ate it his
<i>mana tapu</i>, his personal sacredness, would thereby
be destroyed."</p>

<p>The younger people in the <i>pa</i> were rather awe-stricken
by the preparations for the cannibal feast,
and stood together some distance away from the
<i>hangi</i>. "I stood with them," says one Te Kahu-pukoro,
who was a boy at the time; "I was afraid
to join in the eating, but the savour of the flesh
cooking in the ovens was delightful!"</p>

<p>When the warriors, a little later on, were enjoying
their meal of man-meat, some of the little
children were heard calling out to their fathers:
"<i>Homai he poaka mou</i>" ("Give me some pork to
eat"). They had seen the meat carried up in flax
baskets, and thought it was pork.</p>

<p>Now the white soldiers' funeral pyre was set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
alight. An old man, Titokowaru's <i>tohunga</i>, or priest,
walked up to it with a long stick of green timber in
his hand, an unbarked sapling with a rough crook
at one end. He stood in front of the pile as the
flames shot up and chanted a song. Then, when
the logs with their terrible burdens were well alight,
he began a strange incantation. Using his long
stick with both hands he turned over the burning
logs, pushed them closer together to create a fiercer
heat, and forked the bodies into the midst of the
blaze. And as he did so he recited a pagan <i>karakia</i>,
the chant of the <i>Iki</i>, anciently repeated over the
bodies of warriors when they were being cremated
on the battle-field. These were the words of the
incantation (the mystic meaning underlying some
of the expressions would require many notes to
fully elucidate them):</p>

<p>The people sat there on the <i>marae</i>, silently watching
the burning of the dead. Far above the trees
of the surrounding forest rose the thick black
column of smoke from the blazing pile. It went up
as straight as an arrow, unswayed by any breath
of air, to a great height. To the savage watchers it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was verily the incense of the battle-field, rising to
the war-god's nostrils. "Now and then," says
Bent, "a body would burst, and the blaze of flame
and the smoke would leap straight up, high into
the air."</p>

<p>Long the Hauhaus gazed at the dreadful crematory
blaze on the palisaded <i>marae</i>, replenishing the
fire with dry logs as it burned down, until all the
dead were consumed, and nothing but a great heap
of charcoal and ashes remained.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The revival of the ancient practice of cannibalism
was the most hideously savage feature of Titokowaru's
method of warfare. It was not meat-hunger
in this case; it was a battle-field rite. In olden
Maoridom war was war to the death, and to the
oven; it was no use beating your enemy unless you
killed him, and no use killing him unless you also
ate him. The eating of soldiers' bodies not only
glutted racial revenge; but also&mdash;in Maori eyes&mdash;destroyed
the prestige of the whites; it ruined their
<i>mana</i> as men and as warriors.</p>

<p>The Taranaki Maoris tell a singular little story
in explanation of those man-eating rites in Titokowaru's
camps. In consuming bodies from the
battle-fields they were only putting into practice
the spirit of a speech made by old King Potatau te
Wherowhero a decade or so before.</p>

<p>Potatau&mdash;grandfather of the present "king" of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Waikato, Mahuta Potatau te Wherowhero, M.L.C.&mdash;was
a warrior of exceeding renown three-quarters
of a century ago, and a cannibal of cannibals.</p>

<p>Te Wherowhero Kai-tangata&mdash;"man-devourer"&mdash;he
was called. Many a time he raided Taranaki
with his war-parties of Waikato and Ngati-Maniapoto
and Tainui. At Pukerangiora, about 1830,
he slew hundreds of Ngati-Awa tribespeople, and
with his warriors cooked and ate them. Nearly
thirty years later he was set up as king over the
confederated Maori tribes in the centre of the island.</p>

<p>When the Maori kingdom was first established, the
then governor of the colony visited old Potatau,
and discussed the Maori aspirations for independence.
The governor, according to the Maori story,
endeavoured to show the king the folly of opposing
the sway of the white man; if it did come to warfare&mdash;which
was not then contemplated by either
side&mdash;the British soldiers would soon make a clean
sweep of the ill-armed and ill-provisioned Maori.</p>

<p>"You are wrong," said Potatau; "it will take
you many a year to sweep away the Maoris&mdash;you
will never do it."</p>

<p>"But," said the governor, "suppose we fight
you, and drive you into the forest, far away from
your cultivations, what will you do for food?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied the old king, "I have plenty of
food even in the bush&mdash;the berries of the <i>tawa</i> and
<i>karaka</i> trees, the heart of the <i>mamaku</i> tree-fern,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and the <i>nikau</i>, and other foods of the forest. We
can live on those."</p>

<p>"And suppose I chase you with my soldiers, and
fight you in the forest, and pursue you so that you
cannot even get those things to eat, the berries and
the <i>mamaku</i>, what then will you do for food?"</p>

<p>Said old Potatau, grinning, "Then I'll eat
you!"<a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a>
<a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>This half-defiant, half-jocular speech of the venerable
warrior of Waikato was repeated word for
word, as it is given here, in every Kingite village
and in the Hauhau <i>pas</i> of after years; but it was
left for Titoko's bushmen of Taranaki to put into
actual execution their old foeman's commissariat
methods.</p>

<p>"Titokowaru heard it," say the Maoris; "and
when the war began, and he became a fighting chief,
he did as Potatau would have done&mdash;he fought his
enemy in the forest, and slew him there, and ate
his flesh for food. And, as Potatau had predicted,
it was many a year before the war was ended&mdash;and
even then Titokowaru was never caught."</p>

<p class="center">SKIRMISHING AND FORT-BUILDING</p>

<p class="blockquote">Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu abandoned&mdash;On the march again&mdash;Skirmishing
on the Patea&mdash;<i>Pakeha</i> in pickle&mdash;A new stockade&mdash;Bent the
<i>pa</i>-builder.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">The</span> famous "Bird's-Beak" <i>pa</i>, made so memorable
by the terrible scenes enacted around and
within its stockade, was soon deserted.</p>

<p>Titokowaru, not long after the Hauhau victory
and the savage rites narrated in the last chapter,
issued an order that the village must be evacuated,
and a new position selected for a bush-fort in which
to withstand the attack that must inevitably be
delivered against him by the Government. So one
day the whole of the inhabitants of the Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu&mdash;men,
women, and children, and the
solitary white man&mdash;having gathered together their
belongings, marched out of their village and
tramped away through the bush eastwards. The
armed men of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> preceded them, to
make sure that the way was clear of the <i>pakeha</i>
enemy.</p>

<p>At the village of Turangaréré and at Taiporohenui
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
they dwelt for a while, and the warriors scouted out
day after day in the vicinity of the European redoubts.
A little skirmishing occurred; some shots
were fired at the Turuturu-Mokai redoubt, now re-garrisoned,
and a sniping party amused themselves,
with the Manawapou Camp as a target. Before
very long Bent and his companions were once more
on the move, swagging through the bush to the
Patea Valley. The scene of war was now to be the
Lower Patea and the Waitotara, whence Titokowaru,
it was believed, intended to raid the town
of Wanganui.</p>

<p>For some weeks Titoko and his Hauhaus camped
in the Oruatihi <i>pa</i>. Then they shifted to Otoia,
near the banks of the Patea, where they built a
redoubt, from which they could fire into the European
position at Manutahi. The fortification was
finished in a day and a night, all hands, men and
women, toiling at it, Bent amongst them. Some
dug the trenches with their spades, some carried
earth in flax baskets, and others piles of flax and
fern, with which they built up the parapets.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the day after the <i>pa</i> was
completed there was a brush with the Government
forces. A column of Armed Constabulary and
Wanganui Maoris made a reconnaissance up the
cliffy, forest-fringed banks of the Patea in the direction
of the Hauhau redoubt. Titoko's men attacked
them, lining both sides of the river. The troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
retired to their tea after a pretty little skirmish;
and the Hauhaus marched back to the <i>pa</i> in high
jubilation, singing war-songs, waving their guns,
and bounding about and grimacing like a company
of fiends. Then the steaming pork and potatoes,
and speech-making and howling <i>hakas</i> around the
great camp-fires. From the Maori point of view,
quite a pleasant day's sport.</p>

<p>During the two months following the bush fight
at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu no serious engagement
occurred, but Titokowaru's war-parties scoured the
district for many miles, laid ambuscades on the
tracks between the European redoubts, burned
settlers' houses, and bagged a stray <i>pakeha</i> or
two.</p>

<p>One incident of this period illustrates the peculiar
ghoulish humour of the Hauhau savage. Two
friendly Maoris&mdash;Nga-hina and another&mdash;who were
mail-carriers in the Government service, halted
awhile at Manawapou one day, while on their way
to Patea, and searched the settlement there for the
wherewithal for a dinner. A cask stood beside one
of the <i>wharés</i>, and on taking the top off they found
it to be a barrel of brine, containing meat&mdash;apparently
pork.</p>

<p>Anticipating a good meal of salt pork, they fished
up some of the meat. They found to their disgust
that it was human flesh!&mdash;"Long-pig!" Not being
Hauhaus or cannibals, they dropped the man-meat&mdash;white man&mdash;back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
into the cask and stayed
their hunger on good honest potatoes.</p>

<p>The question was, who pickled the <i>pakeha</i>? A
Hauhau prisoner some time later enlightened the
Government Maoris. A scouting party from Titoko's
camp had dodged down to Manawapou, and
discovered there, not far from the redoubt&mdash;which
had been temporarily vacated by the troops&mdash;a
new-made grave. Opening it, they disinterred a
white man's corpse. In sheer devilment they cut
it up, put it into a cask of brine that stood handy,
and then recovered the cask and left it.</p>

<p>It would have been an exquisite joke, from the
cannibal Hauhau view-point, had the Government
soldiers unknowingly helped themselves to a joint
of white man!</p>

<p>Titokowaru's entrenched position at Otoia was
not a strong one, and shortly he, after a council of
war with his principal men, decided to abandon it
and build a new bush <i>pa</i>, which should be as nearly
impregnable as a Maori fort could be.</p>

<p>So one morning a long line of Hauhaus of all
ages and both sexes&mdash;the armed men in front and
rear&mdash;bearing their simple belongings in flax-basket
<i>pikaus</i> on their backs, left the Otoia redoubt,
and marched away through the bush to a
spot about twelve miles from the mouth of the
Patea River and a mile and a half from the old
Okotuku <i>pa</i>, which had been attacked by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
troops two years previously. At this place, Moturoa&mdash;the
"Song Bush," so called because of a long
strip of forest which covered the plain here&mdash;the
war-chief ordered that the new fort should be constructed.</p>

<p>The position was on partially cleared land, nearly
level, surrounded by the forest. The men, after
hastily constructing huts, roofed with the fronds of
tree-fern and <i>nikau</i>, set to work with their axes to
hew out a large clearing. Titoko marked out the
lines of the entrenchments and palisades. The
forest-trees quickly fell before the practised assault
of many bushmen, and the shrubby cover in front
of the <i>pa</i> was carefully burned.</p>

<p>Then came the setting up of the stockade. <i>Tawa</i>
and other trees of small size were cut into suitable
lengths for the palisade-posts. There were two rows
of palisades; the outside one was the largest and
strongest. For the heavy outside row of stockading,
timbers from eight to twelve inches in diameter
were sunk solidly in the ground, forming a
wall some ten feet high. Saplings were cut to serve
as cross-ties or rails to lash across the posts, and
with supplejack and <i>aka</i> vines the whole were bound
strongly and closely together.</p>

<p>Kimble Bent worked with the Hauhaus&mdash;toiling
like a navvy, cutting timber, setting up the great
posts, lashing the palisading, and digging trenches.
He wore nothing but a rough flax mat round his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
waist&mdash;trouserless, bootless, hatless. In everything
but skin a Maori.</p>

<p>"It was exciting," says the white man, "but none
the less it was slavery. Many a night those times,
when I lay down on my flax <i>whariki</i>, though I was
dog-tired, I could not sleep&mdash;thinking, thinking over
the past, and dreading what the future might bring
me. Many and many a time I wished myself dead
and out of it all."</p>

<p>What furious, what Homeric toil was that <i>pa</i>-building!
Those wild brown men, spurred by the
reports of speedy attack, laboured with incredible
energy and swiftness. The Moturoa fortified hold&mdash;which
later became known as Papa-tihakehake,
because of the battle which befell here&mdash;was completed
in three days&mdash;stockaded, trenched, parapeted,
and rifle-pitted&mdash;ready for the enemy!</p>

<p>Behind the strong tree-trunk stockade there were
trenches and casemated rifle-pits from which the
defenders could fire between the lower interstices in
the great war-fence; behind the trenches again
was a parapet from which a second line of Hauhaus
could deliver their fire over the top of the palisade.
It was one of the strongest works yet constructed
by the Maoris, and one that was not likely to be
stormed except at the cost of many lives.</p>

<p class="center">THE FIGHT AT MOTUROA STOCKADE</p>

<p class="blockquote">K&#257;tené's vigil&mdash;Attack on the stockade&mdash;Major Hunter's death&mdash;A
Hauhau warrior's desperate feat&mdash;Over the palisades&mdash;Government
forces repulsed&mdash;A rear-guard fight&mdash;An unanswered prayer&mdash;Scenes

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> within the stockade of the Moturoa, or Papa-tihakehake
<i>pa</i>,<a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a>
<a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> there was a small, roughly built
<i>taumaihi</i>, or look-out stage, ten or twelve feet above
the ground, high enough to allow a sentinel to see
well over the sharp-pointed palisades, and scan the
approaches to the fort.</p>

<p>In this bush watch-tower there stood, at misty
dawn on a grey November morning, the Hauhau
scout and warrior K&#257;tené Tu-Whakaruru.</p>

<p>K&#257;tené was cold, and he stamped his bare feet
upon the unbarked logs that floored the sentry-box,
and he chanted softly to himself a little <i>waiata</i>
to Kopu, the morning star, which he had looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
for in vain, for a heavy drizzling mist obscured
everything. The thin, persistent rain penetrated
the blanket that he held closely wrapped about him.</p>

<p>Presently a faint light began to steal over the
forest, and K&#257;tené could see the outlines of the
black charred stumps and burned trees in front of
the <i>pa</i>, then beyond the gloomy woods, through
which a narrow winding path led to the open fern-lands
of the Wairoa.</p>

<p>Suddenly K&#257;tené's murmured chant ceased, and
he strained his eyes into the mist. To a Maori
forester the slightest sound was enough to set
every faculty on the alert, asking suspiciously, "<i>He
aha tena!</i>" He had heard a faint sound in the
direction of the track beyond the black tree-stumps,
a sound that he fancied resembled the striking of
steel against steel.</p>

<p>K&#257;tené hardly breathed. His eyes glared fixedly
through the mist. In a few minutes his vision confirmed
the evidence of his keen ears. He saw, just
for a moment, a dark figure, then another, come
hazily out of the wet fog where the track from the
Wairoa emerged on the clearing, then disappear, as
if they had suddenly dropped to the ground or
vanished behind a tree.</p>

<p>That glimpse was enough for K&#257;tené. He
dropped from his sentry-perch, and ran from
<i>wharé</i> to <i>wharé</i> and tent to tent giving the alarm.</p>

<p>"The soldiers are coming!" he said to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
whom he awakened. "The soldiers are on us!
They are by now entering the clearing. Get your
arms quickly! Man the trenches! But don't make
a sound!"</p>

<p>The fighting-men poured out of their sleeping
huts, snatching up their weapons and accoutrements,
and ran to their places in the pits and ditches
behind the stockade. They hastily loaded their
<i>tuparas</i>, their rifles, and their carbines, and, peering
eagerly through the defence-works, sought to penetrate
the raw, damp morning mist that shrouded
their front.</p>

<p>The whole bush-castle was alive and ready.
Every man and boy who could shoulder a gun was in
the well-hidden firing lines.</p>

<p>The wet mist slightly lifting as the morning light
came, the musketeers presently saw dim figures
moving out from the dark forest on their front and
right and left flanks. Moving quickly, half running,
in a cautious, crouching gait, they flitted from tree
to tree, and burnt stump to stump, and nearer and
nearer to the stockade.</p>

<p>Not a sound came from the breathlessly waiting
warriors, nor from the ghost-like figures that now
sank to the ground, each behind a log or a great
blackened stump, or the butt of a standing tree.</p>

<p>Gun in hand, finger on the trigger, the Hauhaus
waited.</p>

<p>The apparitions were picked bush-fighters of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
New Zealand forces, led by Colonel Whitmore, seeking
to surprise Titoko in his forest-den.</p>

<p>Advancing silently in skirmishing order through
the bush, they took cover, waiting for light enough
to fight by. There were detachments of four
divisions of the Armed Constabulary, many of them
veteran bush-fighters, and men of the Patea Rifles
and Patea Cavalry. There, too, came Kepa's
Whanganui Maoris, with rifle and tomahawk, old
hands on the war-trail, and eager for another brush
with their ancient enemies of Taranaki.</p>

<p>There were two hundred Government men fronting
the fort, but the fighting men behind the
palisades did not, according to Maori accounts,
number many more than half the number.</p>

<p>Amongst Titokowaru's men, however, there were
some of the most renowned bush scouts and warriors
in Taranaki, including&mdash;besides K&#257;tené, the wide-awake
sentry&mdash;such men as the veteran Te Waka-tapa-ruru,
Paraone Tuteré, one of the best Hauhau
shots, Timoti, the fiercest of the cannibals of
Nga-Rauru, and the active young warrior Tutangé
Waionui, he who had despatched von Tempsky on
the battle-field of Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu. Tutangé
says that he was asleep in a tent when K&#257;tené gave
the alarm that morning. He was with his tribe,
the Nga-Rauru, most ferocious of all Maori bush-fighters,
who occupied one end of the <i>pa</i>; the other
tribes holding the fort were Ngati-Ruanui and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Pakakohi. It was the side occupied by the Pakakohi
men that was first attacked.</p>

<p>All at once, as the Hauhaus crouched behind
their palisades squinting for a sight of <i>pakeha</i>, with
impatient fingers on their gun-triggers, fifty or sixty
blue and grey figures sprang from cover and charged
for the stockade. Some of the assaulting party
ran past the corner of the war-fence, looking for
some opening or gateway by which they might
charge in.</p>

<p>The leading files were within a few paces of the
high, solidly set palisading, when suddenly the whole
face of the fence flashed fire, and volleys crashed
in terrifying reverberations that set flocks of sleepy
<i>kaka</i> parrots flying, screaming harsh screams of
fright, through the dark forest.</p>

<p>Nearly half the storming party of A.C.'s fell before
that fearful fire.</p>

<p>The first man shot was their leader, a brave
officer, Major Hunter, whose brother, Captain
Hunter, had fallen at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu two
months previously. Tutangé says that it was
Paraone Tuteré who shot the major; he fired at
the leading figure, not knowing then who he was.
Colonel Whitmore came running in with the
stormers, but, with his usual luck, although in the
thickest fighting he was never hit.</p>

<p>Those of the attacking column who were not hit
instantly dropped to cover amongst the logs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
stumps that surrounded the <i>pa</i> front. Then they
returned the fire as well as they could, but one man
after another was hit, without being able to see
one Hauhau of the scores that occupied the <i>pa</i> and
thrust the muzzles of their guns through the interstices
of the palisades.</p>

<p>It was a foolish thing, that blind frontal charge
on the strong stockade. Major Hunter was too good
a soldier to have done such an insane thing of his
own volition. He was obeying Whitmore's orders.
Hunter was shot in the femoral artery, when within
nine or ten yards of the stockade. He implored
those near him to try to stop the gushing blood,
and some of his comrades attempted to staunch it;
but the wound was too close to the stomach to get
at, and he died in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Captain W. E. Gudgeon, with about forty Government
Maoris, tried to work round and take the <i>pa</i>
in the rear. His line of charge was on Hunter's
right flank, and he had good cover, but in spite of
that he lost two killed and five wounded.</p>

<p>Now a brisk little fight went on on the flanks of
the <i>pa</i> between Kepa's men and a party of warriors
who had made a sortie from the stockade. Kepa
was furiously assailed by the bushmen, leaping from
tree to tree, yelling their frightful Hauhau cries;
and it was as much as the plucky Whanganui men
could do to hold their own. Their attempt to take
the <i>pa</i> in the rear failed, and they at last slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
withdrew to support the shattered ranks of their
white comrades.</p>

<p>The A.C. supports came doubling up, and a heavy
fire was concentrated on the stockade, but to little
purpose. It was impregnable to rifle-fire, and in
their pitted works the defenders were able to pick
off the white skirmishers in perfect safety.</p>

<p>Bullets swept the clearing in every direction, and
through the infernal music of the forest-battle the
white soldiers heard the loudly yelled war-cries of
the chiefs and the shrill voices of the Maori women
as they encouraged their warriors, husbands, and
brothers, and screamed them on to slaughter with
all the fury of brown tattooed Hecates.</p>

<p>The women were gathered in the <i>marae</i> and in
the trenches, some armed, all filled with the fire of
savage war.</p>

<p>"<i>Ka horo, ka horo!</i>" they shouted. "<i>Kia maia,
kia maia! Patua, kainga! Patua, kainga!</i>"
("They fall, they fall! Be brave, oh, be brave!
Kill them, eat them! Kill them, eat them!")</p>

<p>All this time Kimble Bent was walking to and
fro on the <i>parepare</i>, the inner breastwork, the
bullets screaming <i>zssh! zssh!</i> over his head and
all about him. The air seemed filled with flying
lead, yet very few Maoris were hit. One woman
he saw shot dead through the head as she rose to
wave her shawl and yell a fighting cry to the men
at the palisades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>And here Bent was an eye-witness of the most
desperately daring deed he had ever seen.</p>

<p>A fiery old tattooed warrior, by name Te Waka-tapa-ruru&mdash;the
Hauhau mentioned in an earlier
chapter as the man who had killed Charles Broughton,
Government Native Agent, on the Patea River,
in 1865&mdash;was in a quiver of excitement while the
garrison awaited the assault, and could hardly be
silenced until the attack was delivered.</p>

<p>When the <i>pakeha</i> storming party rushed up at
the double, the old man was one of the first to open
fire on them with his <i>tupara</i>. And then, when the
order "<i>Kokiritia!</i>" ("Charge!") was given, and the
Hauhaus rushed out to engage the Government
men who were trying to work round to the rear of
the <i>pa</i>, he led the wild charge.</p>

<p>Perfectly naked, except for the broad flax waist-girdle,
which held his short-handled tomahawk, and
gripping his double-barrelled gun, the tall old
savage took a great running jump at the stockade
from the inner parapet, and leaped clean over it!</p>

<p>Yelling a <i>Pai-mariré</i> battle-cry as he rose from
the ground after his extraordinary leap, he snatched
the tomahawk from his belt, and charged straight
for the advancing whites.</p>

<p>It was a fit of <i>whakamomori</i>&mdash;sheer blind desperation,
utter recklessness of death.</p>

<p>Possibly the furious old fanatic imagined that his
Hauhau angel and his mesmeric password, "<i>Hapa!</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
<i>Pai-mariré! Hau!</i>" would avert the bullets of
the <i>pakeha</i>. But he was killed in the very charge&mdash;the
only Maori fighting-man killed that day.</p>

<p>Two white soldiers met him. He was in the act of
striking a desperate blow when a <i>pakeha</i> ball took
him square in the forehead, and with a huge convulsive
bound and a half-choked barking "<i>Hau!</i>"
on his lips, the old tattooed brave fell dead amongst
the foremost of his enemies.</p>

<p>It was just the death that he desired&mdash;face to the
foe, with his war-axe in his hand&mdash;the death of a
true Maori <i>toa</i>!</p>

<p>This savage hero's son, Ratoia&mdash;now living in the
village of Taiporohenui&mdash;a young boy at the time
of the fight, saw his father's great leap over the
palisade, and saw him killed.</p>

<p>Bent tells of a curious <i>matakité</i>, or prophetic dream,
which Te Waka-tapa-ruru had on the night before
the battle. The old man was a close friend of the
white runaway, and they were accustomed to sleep
side by side on the <i>whariki</i>-spread floor of one of
the huts. He dreamed that he saw his face reflected
in a <i>pakeha</i> looking-glass, and that he was
combing his hair. This vision disturbed the old
man, and deeming it a warning from the unseen
world, he asked Titokowaru&mdash;just when the approach
of the troops was first announced&mdash;what it
might portend. The war-chief interpreted the
dream as an omen of death, and warned Te Waka
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
not to leave the shelter of the stockade during the
impending engagement or he would be killed. But
he disregarded this in his fit of <i>whakamomori</i>, and
ran amok, and so he fell.</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to take such a strong and
well-defended position by storm, the white colonel
withdrew his forces. There were dead and wounded
lying all over the place. The <i>pakehas</i> succeeded in
carrying off the wounded and some of the dead,
including the gallant Major Hunter. A number of
dead, however, had to be left where they were lying,
for it was death to attempt their removal from
under the very muzzles of the Hauhau guns.</p>

<p>The rescue of Hunter's body from the Hauhau
tomahawks, under a heavy fire, was a gallant piece
of work. Captain Gudgeon was one of those who
brought the dead officer out; one of his comrades
was Captain Edward McDonnell, and troopers
Foote and Kelly were amongst the others. Two
or three men were shot in the attempt. Kepa
(Major Kemp) was there, too, but he was pretty
well engaged in looking after his own men and
extricating them from that place of death.</p>

</div>

<p>The Colonial soldiers retired, fighting a hard rear-guard
action, out to the edge of the bush. Each
division of Armed Constabulary in turn halted, knelt
down facing the enemy, and covered the retreat of
the other divisions, thus giving time for those of
the dead and wounded who had been recovered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
be carried off the field. Out to the fern-lands the
Hauhaus followed the troops, sometimes engaging
them so closely that the fighting was hand-to-hand,
and it was carbine and revolver against long-handled
tomahawk. The skirmishing lasted until
the whites were well clear of the bush; the Maoris
would have followed them out even to their camp,
the Wairoa Redoubt, had not they been recalled by
orders from Titokowaru. The battle of Papa-tihakehake
was over. It was a more severe repulse
for the Government men than even the engagement
at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu a bare two months before.
One man out of every four in the force actually
engaged was on the casualty list&mdash;more than
twenty killed and quite thirty wounded.<a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a>

<p>A grim story of that hard-fought retreat through
the bush is told by Kimble Bent.</p>

<p>After the <i>kokiri</i>, the rush out in pursuit, had been
ordered by the Maori war-chief, one of the Nga-Rauru
men came across a white soldier lying on
the ground, with his head pillowed against a fallen
<i>pukatea</i>-tree. He had been cut off from his division
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
by the foremost of the pursuing Hauhaus, and was
lying there feigning death, hoping that the rest of
the Maoris would pass on and not notice him.</p>

<p>The Nga-Rauru man, however, stopped and
looked closely at the prostrate <i>pakeha</i>. He said to
one of his comrades, "I don't think that man is
dead." Going up to the Constabulary man, he
put his hand on his shoulder, and said in English,
"Wake up!"</p>

<p>The white man opened his eyes. He exclaimed,
"Save my life! Let me go, and I'll never forget
you&mdash;I'll repay you for it."</p>

<p>The Nga-Rauru man, who must have been a
humorous kind of barbarian, said to his victim,
again in English, "Go on your knees and pray to
your God to save your life!"</p>

<p>The soldier knelt as he was told, and ejaculated
some sort of a prayer.</p>

<p>Playing with his prey, the savage asked, "Well,
are you saved now?"</p>

<p>The kneeling soldier looked up, but could make
no answer. He stared at his terrible-looking captor,
with horror in his eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Poroporoaki ki to Atua!</i>" ("Say farewell to
your God!") cried the Maori, and swinging his gun
round in both hands, he brought it butt down with
a frightful smashing blow on the soldier's head.</p>

<p>The man fell backwards dead. His slayer stripped
him of his uniform and accoutrements, and a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
later could have been seen dancing a furious <i>haka</i>
in front of the stockade, his face blackened with
charcoal from the charred tree-stumps, the soldier's
cap on his head, and the captured carbine in his
hand.</p>

<p>Young Tutangé Waionui was in the thick of the
skirmishing. "My weapons that day," he says,
"were a <i>tupara</i> (double-barrelled gun) and a revolver.
The gun was a muzzle-loader; I preferred
it to the breech-loaders used by the <i>pakeha</i>, because
something was always going wrong with them. I
could load (<i>puru-pu</i>) very quickly; but a quicker
man was old Te Waka-tapa-ruru&mdash;he who was killed;
there was no one so expert as he at loading a
muzzle-loader."</p>

<p>What scenes of horror followed that battle in
the bush!</p>

<p>The Hauhaus were in a delirium of triumphant
savagery. Like frenzied things they came dancing
and yelling back to the <i>pa</i>. They had blackened
their ferocious faces with charcoal from the burnt
tree-stumps in front of the <i>pa</i>. Singing war-songs,
shouting <i>Pai-mariré</i> cries, dancing their weapons
in the air, projecting their long snaky tongues and
rolling their eyes till only the whites were visible,
set in a petrifying glare&mdash;the grimace of the <i>pukana</i>&mdash;it
was a sight that brought fear to the heart of
the lone white man, accustomed though he was by
this time to spectacles of barbaric ferocity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>The women were as wild and savage-looking as
the men&mdash;their dark eyes blazing with excitement,
their faces black-painted like the warriors, their
loosened hair flying behind them, many of them
nude from the waist up&mdash;waving shawls, mats,
tomahawks, in welcome to the returning heroes,
shouting, singing, screaming.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Outside the front fence of the <i>pa</i>, just us they
fell, among the logs and stumps and on the blood-stained
ground, lay the dead men whom the retreating
A.C.'s had been compelled to leave on the
battle-field. There were seven of them.</p>

<p>Upon these fallen soldiers rushed the Hauhaus.
They stripped them of their uniforms. They tied
flax-leaf ropes round the necks of the dead <i>pakehas</i>,
and hauled them away to the gateway of the <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>As they dragged the corpses off, leaping from
side to side as they hauled in a fury of blood-madness,
they shouted out such sentences as these:</p>

<p>"<i>Taku kai! Taku kai! E hara ka kite noho koe
taku kai, taku tika, taku he! Nau te kino, naku
whakahoki ton kino. Taea hokitia&mdash;te mahi o te
atua a Titokowaru!</i>" ("My food! My food!
Behold my food; behold the right and the wrong
of it all. 'Twas you"&mdash;addressing the slain&mdash;"that
wrought the evil work. And I have returned your
evil. Behold the work of the god of Titokowaru!")</p>

<p>A young Hauhau, huge-limbed and naked but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
for a very brief waist-mat of dangling flax, leaps
to the side of one of the white men's bodies, just
as it is harnessed in so revolting a fashion to be
dragged into the <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>His tomahawk flashes in the air above him as he
steps over the fallen soldier&mdash;once, twice, thrice!</p>

<p>He thrusts in a hand into a huge gaping wound
in the dead man's breast; he is searching for something.
He rises with some object, all bloody, in his
horrible red hand. He sticks his tomahawk back
into his girdle, he comes bounding from the corpse,
waving his dripping trophy in his hand, swinging
it round his head. His fiendish yells ring echoing
over the forest clearing.</p>

<p>What is it he flourishes so exultingly?</p>

<p>It is the white man's heart!</p>

<p>This is the young warrior Tihirua, the priest of
the burnt sacrifice. He has torn out the <i>manawa</i>
of the soldier, as a <i>mawé</i>&mdash;an offering to the God
of War!</p>

<p>At his waist, buckled to his flax girdle, is a
leather pouch, such as was generally used for
carrying percussion-caps. Out of this he takes
matches&mdash;<i>pakeha</i> matches! Striking match after
match, he holds them underneath the bleeding
heart until it is singed, and dark smoke goes up
from it&mdash;incense to Uenuku, the war-god, who
appears to his savage worshippers in the arch of
the rainbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The heathen rite&mdash;the ceremony of the <i>Whangai-hau</i>&mdash;performed,
Tihirua flings down his terrible
trophy, and then directs the hauling of the bodies
into the palisaded inferno.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Bent, standing just outside the <i>pa</i> gateway,
watched the in-bringing of the bodies of his fellow-whites&mdash;prelude,
he too well knew, to a cannibal
feast.</p>

<p>He turned to enter the village, when an old
Maori, tugging away madly at a flax line which he
had made fast to the neck of a dead man, caught
sight of him, and shouted:</p>

<p>"You, <i>pakeha</i>! Come and give me a hand. Help
me to drag in my food!"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Bent heard a rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
voice ask. He turned and saw the war-chief
Titokowaru standing at his side. "What do you
want of this <i>pakeha</i>?"</p>

<p>The Maori replied that he wished the white man
to help him haul the soldier's body into the <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>"No!" cried the chief in his great hoarse voice.
"No! you must not call upon my <i>pakeha</i> to help
you. He shall not touch the bodies of his countrymen."</p>

<p>So the war-captain and his cartridge-maker stood
by watching the frightful procession of Hauhaus
and their prizes. The seven naked bodies were
dragged into the <i>pa</i> and laid out in the centre of
the <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>The excited people all gathered in a great circle
around the bodies. One after another the orators
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
leaped out from the squatting ranks, their eyes
flashing wildly in the <i>pukana</i> glare; they bounded
to and fro, and cut the air with their tomahawks
as they told the thrilling episodes of the fight.</p>

<p>All the clothes, arms, and accoutrements taken
from the dead and wounded were laid before Titokowaru.</p>

<p>"Whose was this?" the war-chief would ask,
picking up a carbine, or an ammunition-pouch, or
a soldier's tunic from the heap.</p>

<p>"Mine," replied the man who had taken it on
the battle-field.</p>

<p>"Take it away, then," said Titokowaru. "Whose
is this?" picking up another trophy.</p>

<p>"It is mine," a young man would reply; "it is
my first spoils of war, a <i>tanga-ika</i>."</p>

<p>"Burn it," was the chief's order.</p>

<p>Then the human bodies lying on the <i>marae</i> were
apportioned one by one, to each tribe, as piles
of food are served out at a ceremonial Maori
gathering.</p>

<p>"Nga-Rauru, this is yours! Tangahoé, this is
yours!" and so on, till the seven bodies were all
disposed of.</p>

<p>A woman sat weeping on the <i>marae</i>. She was
Te Hau-karewa, wife to one Te Rangi-whakairi-papa
and a sister of Te Waka-tapa-ruru, the old
warrior who had fallen in his desperate rush upon
the white enemy that morning. Though old, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
was a tall, fine-looking woman, with a mass of black
curly hair.</p>

<p>Ceasing her <i>tangi</i> for the dead, when the bodies
of the soldiers were laid out on the ground, she
rose, and, taking a stick in her hand, she walked
along the row of the dead men and struck each a
blow on the head.</p>

<p>"<i>Upoko-kohua!</i>" she cried vehemently, with
hate flashing in her eyes; "<i>Upoko-kohua! Ka
taona koe ki te umu, he utu mo taku tungane kua
mate, ko Te Waka-tapa-ruru! Mehemea ko au i
tata i taku tungane i te takiwa i mate ai, ka kainga
au i te karu o te tangata nana i whakamatea Te
Waka!</i>" ("Boiled heads! Cursed heads! Soon
ye'll be cooked in the oven, as payment for the
death of my brother, Te Waka-tapa-ruru. Had I
but been near my brother when he fell, I would
have swallowed the eyes of the man who slew him!")</p>

<p>Then, throwing away her stick, she sat down
again, and fell to weeping in the very abandonment
of woe, for the savage woman of the woods loved
her grim warrior-brother greatly.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Some of the Maoris proposed that the bodies of
the slain whites, the "Fish of Whiro," should all be
burned or buried.</p>

<p>But up leaped Timoti, wildest of all the wild
Waitotara tribe, the cannibal Nga-Rauru, a thin,
savage-faced fellow, very dark of complexion, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
active and agile as a wild cat. He ran up and down
in front of his slain enemies, turning from one side
to the other, <i>pukana</i>-ing&mdash;only the whites of his
eyes showing&mdash;and his tongue protruded in derision
and defiance. He flashed his tomahawk in the air;
he yelled, "We must have one body&mdash;one body to
cook in the <i>hangi</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said another of the clan, "the customs
of our fathers must be observed. What is the use
of killing so many <i>pakehas</i> if we cannot have one
to eat?"</p>

<p>No man making objection, several Hauhaus
jumped up and ran to the heap of slain Constabulary
men. They selected a body, and dragged it off to
the cooking-place at the rear of the <i>marae</i>. "He is
the fattest of the <i>pakehas</i>," said the saturnine
Timoti.</p>

<p>All eyes watched them, but no man said a word.</p>

<p>Bent, after a while, rose with some of his Hauhau
companions, and walked over to the cooking-<i>hangis</i>,
and watched the cooks at their horrible work.</p>

<p>They were roasting the white man's body on the
great fire of hot stones, in a hollowed-out earth-oven.
"It was being cooked," says Bent, "much
as you would roast a piece of mutton; they turned
it over and over until it was thoroughly done, and
then they cut it up for the feast."</p>

<p>When the cannibal meal was ready, it was brought
on to the <i>marae</i> with much ceremony in flax
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
baskets. Potatoes had been steam-boiled in other
<i>hangis</i> at the same time, and these were carried to
the assembly-ground, to be eaten with the man-meat.
Bent saw the flesh of the soldier eaten.
The man-eaters, he says, all belonged to the Waitotara
tribe. Ten of them consumed the <i>pakeha</i>, or
as much of him as was borne to the <i>marae</i>; the
rest of the people did not share in the feast. Titokowaru
himself would not eat human flesh, because
of his <i>tapu</i>.</p>

<p>"I noticed," says the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori, "Timoti and
Big Kereopa, each with a basket before them,
enjoying the meal of human flesh. Timoti
grabbed up his portion of meat from his basket,
and ate it just as if he were eating a piece of
bread."</p>

<p>Then Titokowaru rose and, crying in a loud voice,
ordered the people to burn the rest of the corpses,
so that they should not defile the <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>The bundles of clothing from the dead lay on
the <i>marae</i>. The Maoris gave Bent three pairs of
soldiers' trousers, four shirts, and some boots. "I
tell you I was pleased," says the old <i>pakeha</i>-Maori,
who had no inconvenient scruples on the
subject of dead men's clothes; "for a long time
I had been wearing only Maori-made garments
of flax."</p>

<p>A great pile of wood was collected, heaped up
six or seven feet high, and in the evening, as darkness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
fell, the bodies of the <i>pakehas</i> were placed on
this funeral pyre and cremated.</p>

<p>The people squatted round&mdash;as they had sat at
a similar ceremony in the "Bird's Beak" <i>pa</i>&mdash;and
watched the flames devour their fallen foemen.
And by the light of the great fire roaring away there
on the <i>marae</i>, Titokowaru <i>taki</i>'d up and down,
addressing his followers, and bounding and parading
to and fro, his sacred feather-plumed <i>taiaha</i> in
his hand. He recited incantations, and chanted
songs, and exhorted the Hauhaus, bidding them be
of good heart and fight to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Then Titokowaru turned to the body of the slain
warrior Te Waka-tapa-ruru, lying on a blanket on
the <i>marae</i>, with gun and tomahawk by his side.
Gazing upon the silent, tattooed features of the
dead <i>toa</i>, his comrade in many a wild foray and
forest battle, he cried the old farewells to those
whose spirits have passed to the <i>Reinga</i>, and he
chanted this lament:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>And the wild <i>korero</i> went on. <i>Tangi</i> songs were
chanted, and there were speeches of savage, boastful
jubilation made&mdash;"great swelling words." But
from a lone little thatched hut on one side of the
crowded parade ground came a long-sustained
crying sound, a sobbing heart-breaking dirge, rising
and falling like a Highland coronach&mdash;a keening for
the dead. Te Hau-karewa made lamentation for
her slain warrior.</p>

a perfect and safe retreat for the Hauhaus in the
event of defeat. The country hereabouts was dotted
with the white man's farmsteads; but the whites
had been driven off before Titokowaru's victorious
army, leaving their homes, the labour of many
years, to go up in smoke, and their sheep and cattle
to feed the Hauhau bands. Wanganui town was
only a day's march away, and Titokowaru's council
of chiefs, eager to follow up their victory at Moturoa,
proposed to assault the town and massacre every
soul in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>This old-time village was fixed on by the Hauhau
war-chief as the site of his new fighting <i>pa</i>, for
he abandoned Papa-tihakehake soon after the repulse
of the white forces at that strong stockade.
With the wariness of the Maori strategist, he avoided
a second attack in any one entrenchment, and
sooner than risk another, and possibly disastrous,
engagement at Papa-tihakehake, he took the trouble
to construct an even stronger fortification, a splendid
example of native military engineering genius.</p>

<p>In the building of this new <i>pa</i>, Kimble Bent and
his Hauhau comrades toiled early and late until it
was completed. It was of large size, fully defended
with palisading, trenches, parapet, and rifle-pits.
It was between two and three chains in extreme
length at the rear, with a somewhat narrower front.
The ground in front was bare of forest, but carried
high fern cover; on the flanks were burned clearings,
dotted with blackened tree-stumps and cumbered
with logs; then the forest, with some beautiful
groves of <i>mahoé</i> on its outskirts. Two rows of
palisades, high and strong, were erected around
the position; the posts, solid tree-trunks, were
from six to twelve inches thick and ten to fifteen
feet high; the rows were four feet apart. The
spaces between the larger stockade-posts were filled
in with saplings set upright close together, and
fastened by cross-rails and supplejack ties; these
saplings did not rest in the ground, but hung a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
inches above it, so that between them and the
ground a space was left for the fire of the defending
musketeers, who were enabled to pour volleys from
their trenches inside the war-fence on any approaching
enemy with perfect safety to themselves.
Behind the inner stockading was a parapet about
six feet high and four feet wide, formed of the earth
thrown out of the trenches. The interior of the
<i>pa</i> was pitted everywhere with trenches and covered
ways, so that in the event of attack the defenders
could literally take to the earth like rabbits, and
live underground secure from rifle-fire, and even
from artillery. The place was a network of trenches
with connecting passages, roofed over with timber,
<i>raupo</i>, and <i>toetoe</i> reeds and earth. To any assault
that could be delivered by the Government forces
then available, the fort was practically impregnable.</p>

<p>At one angle of the <i>pa</i> the Hauhau garrison erected
a roughly timbered watch-tower, about thirty-five
feet in height. This tower, or <i>taumaihi</i>, was a
feature of the ancient <i>pas</i> of Maoridom; on its upper
platform a sentinel was posted, day and night, to
give warning of the approach of the enemy. In
front of the <i>pa</i>, outside the palisades, a tall flagstaff
was set up, and on this staff the Hauhau war-flags
were hoisted. There were two gateways in
the rear stockading, giving access to the bush. In
one end of the <i>pa</i> near the rear was a small tent
occupied by Titokowaru. Bent, the cartridge-maker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
lived in a little rush-built <i>wharé</i> towards the other
end, near one of the gateways.</p>

<p>When the stockade was finished the Hauhaus
constructed a <i>tekoteko</i>, a great marionette-like figure
of a man, cut out of a <i>pukatea</i>-tree. It was so
placed that its head stood about fifteen feet above
the ground, well above the front stockade, and it
had loose-jointed arms, to which flax ropes were
fastened, leading down to the trench below. By
manipulating these ropes the arms of the wooden
warrior were made to move in the actions of the
<i>haka</i>, just as if some painted Hauhau were dancing
a dance of defiance on the fortress walls.</p>

<p>When the fort was finished the garrison gathered
in their food supplies, saw to their arms, and for
many weeks waited for the <i>pakeha</i>. Hauhau
scouts and small war-parties daily sallied out from
the fort, seeking game in the shape of stray <i>pakehas</i>.</p>

<p>One of these savage man-hunters was a Ngati-Maniapoto
man from the King Country, whose name
was Pairama, and who had married a Nga-Rauru
woman. He used to go out by himself, looking for
some one or something to kill. Te Pairama returned
to the stockade in huge jubilation one day, bearing
as a trophy of his prowess on the trail a white man's
leg! He had, says Bent, scouted down until he
was close to Kai-iwi. There he spied a white
settler in a grass paddock, carrying a rifle.</p>

<p>Down he crouched at once, and stealthily stalked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the <i>pakeha</i>. Just as the unsuspecting settler came
to the paddock gate, the Maori leaped out from
behind the fence, with a furious snatch tore the
rifle from the man's grasp, and shot him dead with
it. He cut off one of the <i>pakeha's</i> legs with his
tomahawk, and brought it home as proof of his
success on the war-path as proudly as any Indian
ever flourished his take of scalps. Up and down
the <i>marae</i> of the <i>pa</i> he bounded, exhibiting the
captured rifle and severed limb, yelling his war-song,
and loudly boasting that he would that night
cook the <i>pakeha's</i> leg and eat it all himself.</p>

<p>But the warrior's braggadocio received a sharp
check from Titokowaru. The war-chief disapproved
of this sort of thing on the part of irresponsible
young free-lances. "No man must bring
white man's flesh into this <i>pa</i>," he said, "unless
he is one of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>, the war-party sent
out by me. Take that <i>pakeha</i> leg back again at
once and place it alongside the body." And soon
thereafter the disgusted scout, his ardour for "long-pig"
so unexpectedly damped by Titoko's code of
cannibal etiquette, was to be seen trudging back
along the track to the <i>pakeha</i> farm, with sulky
visage and reluctant gait, and a white foot and leg&mdash;raw&mdash;protruding
from a flax basket strapped to his
shoulders.</p>

<p>By day the scouting parties of the Hauhau
"Twelve Apostles" scoured the country; by night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the people gathered round the fires on the <i>marae</i> or
in the big sleeping <i>wharés</i>, and talked and sang and
danced the <i>hakas</i> of which they never wearied.
Wild night-scenes those on the stockaded <i>marae</i>,
with the crowds of blanketed or flax-cloaked men
and women, their wild faces illumined by the leaping
flames, squatting in great circles round the camp
fires, while more than half nude figures leaped and
stamped and slapped their limbs and chests with
resounding slaps, and expelled the air from their
lungs in wolfish "Ooh's!" and "Hau's!" as they
trod the assembly ground in all the fury of the war-dance.
A warrior orator would rise, weapon in
hand, and throwing off his blanket for freedom of
action, go bounding along the <i>marae</i> in front of
the assemblage, shouting short, sharp sentences as
he <i>taki</i>'d to and fro, his athletic figure untrammelled
except for a waist-shawl or short dangling mat, fire
in his movements, and ferocity in every gesture
and in every cry&mdash;the embodiment of belligerent
Maoridom in its savage prime.</p>

<p>Like defiant replying shouts from some hidden
foe in the blackness of the forest that rose in a solid
wall above the rear stockade came the clear echoes
of the roaring <i>haka</i> choruses.</p>

<p>And so the wild night passed, until the camp fires
died down, and the tribespeople sought sleep in
their packed <i>wharepunis</i> and their rush-strewn
burrows; and the melancholy "<i>Kou-kou</i>!" of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
"hundred-eyed" <i>ruru</i>, the bush-owl, was heard, as
the bird-sentry of the night hours cried his watchword
from the forest or a perch on some tall palisade-post.
Yet not all eyes were closed in the <i>pa</i>, for
the Hauhaus, grown wise by much hard experience,
did not neglect the posting of sentries, and a sentinel
watched from the platform in the angle-tower.
At intervals he cried his watch-cry, or raised his
voice in a night-song that rose and fell in measured
cadences like a <i>tangi</i> wail.</p>

<p>The most dreaded hour in Maori warfare was the
dark, dank hour just before the dawn, and then it
was well to be on the qui vive, for Kepa's dusky
forest-rangers and their white comrades the A.C.'s
had a truly unpleasant fashion of attacking their
enemies at most unholy, shivery times, when man
slept soundest. So the watchmen in the tower
were enjoined to extra vigilance in the early morning
hours. And, as in the olden Maori days, out
rang the voice of the high sentinel, chanting his
ancient "<i>Whakaara-pa</i>," his "All's well" song, to
Tarioa and Kopu, the first and morning stars.</p>

<p>This is one of the songs he cried, an old watch-chant
of the Ngati-Toa tribe of Kawhia:</p>

<p>Late one night, as the Hauhaus lay behind their
palisades, Colonel Thomas McDonnell&mdash;a man who
spoke Maori like a native&mdash;rode boldly up to the
<i>pa</i> wall with his escort, and asked for Titokowaru.
He called out in the native tongue, "O Titoko&mdash;where
are you?"</p>

<p>Titoko, summoned from his tent, went down to
the stockade. "I am here!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The white officer cried: "Titoko, I have been
trying to discover your <i>atua</i>, the god which guides
you in your battles. Now I have found it&mdash;I know
the source of your <i>mana</i>. When the wind blows
hard from the <i>whakarua</i> (the north-east), I know
it is the breath of your god, the wind of Uenuku!
But your <i>atua</i> is only a <i>tutua</i>&mdash;a low fellow!"</p>

<p>Spoke Titoko angrily, and said: "McDonnell,
go! Depart at once! If you do not ride away
directly, there will be a blazing oven ready for you!"</p>

<p>McDonnell rode away, and the angry chief returned
to his tent. Why McDonnell should have
paid this daring night visit to the stockade is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
quite clear, but the incident is given just as Bent
narrates it. He and his companions on the <i>marae</i>
heard the dialogue, and Bent says the old fear
struck to his heart when he heard Titokowaru
menacing the white officer with the oven. The
Taranakis seem to have been particularly addicted
to the "ordeal by fire."</p>

<p>"The oven is gaping open for you!" was their
customary threat. Their tribal history abounds,
too, in tales of how some obnoxious neighbours or
others, Ngati-so-and-so, had been effectively disposed
of by the simple process of surrounding their
huts while they slept, fastening the doors, and
then setting fire to the <i>wharés</i>. The only objection
from the Maori point of view to this summary
method of obtaining <i>utu</i> was that it "spoiled the
meat!"</p>

<p>Colonel McDonnell was so conversant with Maori
<i>tikanga</i>&mdash;customs, rules of life, and ways of thought&mdash;that
he was by way of being a <i>tohunga</i>-Maori himself,
and his dramatic twitting of Titokowaru with
the fact that the reputed source of his fighting <i>mana</i>
was within his (McDonnell's) knowledge was a circumstance
that hugely annoyed the old war-chief.</p>

<p>It was just as if so much of his <i>mana-tapu</i> had
passed to his white foeman&mdash;to the rival maker of
strong "war-medicine."</p>

<p>Occasional skirmishes with the white cavalry
patrol-parties enlivened the three months' sojourn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
in Tauranga-ika. In one of these rencontres a young
Wanganui trooper&mdash;now a resident of Wellington&mdash;won
his New Zealand Cross. This was William
Lingard, a member of Captain John Bryce's troop
of Kai-iwi Cavalry.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="HAUHAU_SCOUT" id="HAUHAU_SCOUT"></a>
  <img src="images/i_257.jpg"
      alt="Hauhau Scout" />
  <div class="caption">A HAUHAU SCOUT, TUTANGÉ WAIONUI, OF PATEA.</div>
</div>

<p>Out scouting one day, Bryce took a party of his
men boldly up to the front of the stockade on a
reconnaissance. The place was unusually quiet,
and a white flag was flying on the flagstaff in front
of the <i>pa</i>. One of the cavalrymen, Sergeant Maxwell,
leaping a ditch and hedge that intervened
between the farm lands and the <i>pa</i>, raced right up
close to the stockade, and fired at it. Trooper
Lingard, also leaping the obstacles, with the rest
of the detachment, rode up past the <i>pa</i>. Lingard,
though he could see nothing of the Maoris, raised
his carbine and fired a shot. The next instant the
whole palisade front&mdash;just above the ground, where
the interstices were left for musketry&mdash;was a blaze
of fire, and a storm of lead sang over the little troop.
The Hauhaus, hidden in their trenches, and preserving
complete silence, had waited till the patrol
was within murderously close range. Maxwell was
mortally wounded; but he sat his horse till it
carried him out of range. Several horses were shot,
and fell. One trooper, H. Wright, was pinned to the
ground by his horse falling on his leg, and was unable
to extricate himself, but, nevertheless, drew his
revolver, and kept popping away at the palisades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole <i>pa</i> was now in a roar of battle-excitement.
The Maoris, as they fired, raised their
fearful yells and war-shouts, an infernal din that
almost drowned the cracks of the firearms. Kimble
Bent was there, sitting on the parapet inside the
stockade, and watching the encounter. A burly
framed Hauhau, a herculean savage known as Big
Kereopa&mdash;one of those who had shared in the
cannibal feast at Papa-tihakehake&mdash;dashed out from
the rear of the stockade, armed with a long-handled
tomahawk, and rushed at the helpless <i>pakeha</i>.
Trooper Lingard instantly put his plunging horse
at the Hauhau, and cut at him with his sword.
Another trooper, Tom D. Cummins (now of Wanganui)
took a hand in the combat, and with a shot
from his carbine stopped the charging Hauhau.
He put a bullet into Kereopa, and the big fellow
clapping a hand to his wound&mdash;which was in his
posterior parts&mdash;bolted back into the <i>pa</i> nearly as
quickly as he had come, yelling "I'm shot! I'm
shot!" Lingard, leaning over, got Wright by the
hand, and, though almost dismounted himself, succeeded
in dragging his comrade from under the
fallen horse. Then, noticing a white horse&mdash;which
was usually ridden by one of the Maori scouts&mdash;tethered
to a <i>tutu</i>-bush a short distance from the
palisades, Lingard galloped at it, cut the tether-line
with his sword, and soon had Wright mounted
again and riding down the hill out of range, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the Hauhau bullets whistling close around their
heads. Lingard's rescue of his comrade was a
remarkably plucky bit of work.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>An incident of Hauhau life at this period, illustrative
of the pitilessly savage character of the
olden Maori, is told thus by Kimble Bent:</p>

<p>"While we were living in the <i>pa</i> at Tauranga-ika,
a Hauhau fighting-man named Taketake
quarrelled with his sister. She threatened that
she would run away to the <i>pakehas</i>, and tell them
of the cannibal practices of the rebels. He warned
her that if she did he would shoot her. That evening
she left the <i>pa</i>, and started for the white soldiers'
camp. Taketake loaded his gun and followed her.
Overtaking her on the road, he shot her through
the back and killed her. He returned to the <i>pa</i>
and reported what he had done. A party of men
went out and brought back the murdered woman's
body, and that was all there was about it. No one
interfered with Taketake, or considered what he
had done was a crime. All they said was '<i>Kaitoa!</i>'
('Serve her right')."</p>

<p>While the <i>pakeha</i> attack was awaited, Bent and his
companions spent much of their time in the forest
at the rear of the fort, catching eels in the creeks,
hunting wild pigs, and gathering wild honey for
the garrison food-supplies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A clear</span>, bright, moonlight night of summer; a
moon that silvered the sharp hill-tops of the broken
Maori country, but left black mysterious shadows
in the gorges and river valleys that every few miles
cut deeply into the rolling fern lands; valleys full
of danger and death, for in their depths crept the
war-parties of the savage, laying ambushes, planning
murder and mutilation. On a gently sloping
rise on the open fern lands a hundred white tents,
the camp of the <i>pakeha</i> troops, glittered in the full
moonlight. The sweet bugle-calls of "Lights out"
and the "Last post" rang out for miles across the
wilderness, and except for the piquets and sentries
the camp was soon asleep. But away on the forest
edge, a mile from the safely entrenched camp, a
little band of men, half a dozen scouts, crouched
hiding in the fern, carbines in their hands, watching,
listening. They were the eyes of the army. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
wits, their keenness of vision and hearing, were
pitted this night against the savage men of the
forest, born bushmen, with the cunning of the
Indian.</p>

<p>It was the 17th of January, 1869, nearly three
months after the repulse of the Colonial troops at
the Moturoa stockade. All this time Titokowaru and
his victorious <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i> had everything their
own way on the West Coast, scouring the country-side,
burning settlers' houses, killing cattle, and
strengthening their palisaded position at Tauranga-ika.
The East Coast campaign following on the
Poverty Bay massacre had necessitated the diversion
of nearly all the Constabulary from the West
Coast, until the storming and capture of Te Kooti's
hill-fort Ngatapa and the flight of the rebel chief
to the forests of the Urewera Country enabled
attention to be again given to the Taranaki and
Waitotara Hauhaus. Now, well on in the month
of January, 1869, Colonel Whitmore, with Colonel
Lyon&mdash;a brave one-armed soldier, veteran of the
Crimea&mdash;as his second in command, advanced from
Wanganui with a strong force of Armed Constabulary,
about eight hundred in number, besides a large
body of <i>Kupapas</i>, or friendly Maoris, mostly of the
Whanganui tribe, under Kepa te Rangihiwinui.
The force encamped at the end of the first day's
march near the right bank of the Kai-iwi stream,
about ten miles from Wanganui, and prepared to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
march the next day through the Okehu Gorge and
on to Nukumaru and Tauranga-ika.</p>

<p>This country around the Kai-iwi was mostly open
fern land, but some of the river gullies were filled
with a dense growth of forest. A short distance to
the north of the camp there was a deep gorge, the
valley of the Okehu stream. Through this gorge
a road had been cut some years before, and the
river had been bridged, giving access to Nukumaru
and the Waitotara, and this was the route by
which Colonel Whitmore intended to approach the
Hauhau stronghold. It was, however, plainly a
dangerous place, where the Maoris might easily
lay an ambush. The little colonel was too old a
soldier to run risks of this sort, and he determined
to have the gorge carefully scouted before he took
his column into it.</p>

<p>That afternoon he selected half a dozen of his
most active men, some of them Constabulary, some
volunteers, and as soon as night fell despatched
them to the Okehu, with orders to spend the night
on the fern-covered right bank of the gorge, and find
out if the Maoris were laying an ambuscade in the
bush below. Trooper William Lingard, of Bryce's
Kai-iwi Cavalry&mdash;the young trooper who had distinguished
himself at the Tauranga-ika skirmish
described in the last chapter&mdash;was placed in charge
of the scouts. With him were Chris. Maling, a
young surveyor&mdash;his father had been killed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Maoris years before, and he often declared that he
would never rest until he had killed a Maori with
his own hands in revenge; a Frenchman called
Peter the Guide; three men named Herri, Powell,
and Williamson; and an old Indian soldier named
Mackenzie. It is with this Mackenzie that this
story of a night's scouting expedition is chiefly
concerned.</p>

<p>It was the calmest of nights, a still night when
sounds travelled far, and in silence the little squad
of armed scouts set out from the tented camp in
single file towards the dark gorge of the Okehu.
They marched as silently as Indians, for they were
shod exactly like Indians, in moccasins that felt
the ground as soundlessly as a wild cat's pad.</p>

<p>The making and wearing of those moccasins was
Mackenzie's idea. This veteran soldier was a man
who had been brought out from India by Sir Henry
Cracroft Wilson, when that gentleman settled in
Canterbury. He was, as one of his scouting comrades
says, a fine-looking, resolute man, something
over forty years of age, with hair beginning to turn
grizzly, and a bold, fearless eye. He was partly of
Gurkha blood, and his senses were wonderfully
keen. He had marvellous escapes from death, and
had even been partly scalped. Once when he was
overpowered and felled in a mêlée, a savage had
passed his knife around his head and underneath
the scalp, and was about to "lift his hair" when a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
timely bullet from one of Mackenzie's comrades
knocked his assailant over, and the soldier was
rescued. His companion ran to his aid, pressed
down the torn scalp into its place, and bound it
firmly with bandages. Mackenzie saved his hair,
but to his last day bore the scar of the scalping-knife
running round his head. He carried besides
his carbine a remarkable weapon, a two-ended
steel knife, or dagger, of Afghan make, which he wore
in a sheath at his back with a flap of skin over the
top. One end of the dagger was a stiletto and the
other was a double-edged cutting and thrusting
blade, ground as sharp as a razor. It had the
handle in the middle. With this knife he would perform
some wonderfully dexterous feats. He would
throw it up into the air thirty or forty feet and
catch it by the middle as cleverly as a juggler as it
came whizzing down. He would stick a piece of
paper on a post and, retiring twenty or thirty yards,
hurl the shining weapon at it and transfix the
target in the exact centre, the knife quivering several
inches deep in the post.</p>

<p>The moccasins the scouts wore were made by
Mackenzie from the skin of a horse. Immediately
the party had been organised the old soldier went
out with his carbine and shot one of the numerous
ownerless horses that roamed the hills. Cutting
out suitable pieces of the skin, he fitted them while
still warm to his comrades' feet, with the hair inside;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
then cut thongs and laced the horse-skin shoe
firmly to the foot. In a few hours these moccasins
took perfect shape, and made the most suitable
foot-gear for bush-work that could have been devised.
"If we wear ordinary boots out scouting
we're sure to lose our lives," said Mackenzie; "we
can't scout noiselessly in them, or run fast enough
when it comes to running."</p>

<p>An old Maori war-track wound through the high
fern above the Okehu Gorge. Along this the scouts
marched to take up their night's vigil. Two were
posted at the end of the gorge nearest the camp,
two more about two hundred yards away, and the
third couple about the same distance farther on,
above the middle of the gorge. The men made
themselves nests in the fern alongside the track, and
close to the edge of the slope that fell to the impenetrable
blackness of the bush below. The leader,
as he posted the men, told them to keep a sharp
watch and listen for any sounds, and to give a signal
if any of them heard Maoris in the gorge. The
signal was to be the thrice-repeated sharp cry of the
<i>weka</i>, the night-roving wingless bird that haunted
these forests and gulches.</p>

<p>After posting his comrades in their several positions,
young Lingard rejoined his companion Maling
in a little nook in the thick fern just on the gorge
side of the narrow foot-track, and stayed a while
with him conversing in whispers. In half an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
hour's time he cautiously patrolled the track again
to visit the others. When he came to Mackenzie,
the old soldier was sitting up reading a pocket Bible
by the bright moonlight.</p>

<p>"What are you reading?" asked Lingard, as
he squatted down quietly in the fern by Mackenzie's
side.</p>

<p>"Look and see," said the soldier, and Lingard
saw, and wondered, for not many a rough old
soldier like Mackenzie was seen with such a book.
And he wondered still more when Mackenzie, closing
the book, asked him to look at it again. There
was a clean-cut hole in it, right through one of the
covers and penetrating many of the leaves.</p>

<p>"That book saved my life," said the veteran.
And he told the story. It was the comrade who
had bowled over the Indian who was about to scalp
him that gave Mackenzie the little Bible. "'You
say you will always be grateful to me for saving
your life,' he said. 'Well, I want you to do just
one thing for me; it's a little thing. I won't ask
much.'</p>

<p>"He was so insistent," said Mackenzie, "that
I gave him the promise he asked. 'Well,' said
my friend, 'just take this little book of mine and
read something in it every night; or, if you won't
read it, take it out and look at it and open it. And
always carry it with you. It will save your life.'</p>

<p>"I did so, and I read it, more to please my old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
friend than anything else. I carried it in my
jumper pocket, for it was small and light. And in
those dangerous days I carried something else night
and day&mdash;this dagger that I wear at my belt.
About midnight one night I was lying alone in my
tent, half-asleep, when I heard something&mdash;no,
smelt it! It was pitch dark, but I knew there was
something or some one close to me. As quietly as I
knew how, I loosened my dagger and gripped it
firmly. The next moment I felt a terrible thud on
the chest, and a figure hurled itself on me. I brought
round the knife with a swift sweep, and nearly
ripped the side out of the fellow&mdash;killed him dead.
It was a native who wanted to kill and rob me.
He had jumped at me with a knife, but the point
of his blade struck the Bible in my breast pocket
as I lay on my back, and that saved my life. See!
It's the sort of thing you used to read about in little
Sunday-school books, isn't it? I wonder how
many people would believe it? But it's absolutely
true. That old comrade of mine saved my life
twice. And it's these two I put my trust in, my
Bible and my dagger. That knife's the best weapon
I've ever had. It's more to me than carbine or
revolver."</p>

<p>Then Mackenzie put his hand on his fellow-scout's
arm, and spoke in an earnest whisper of a
presentiment that filled his mind.</p>

<p>"I feel," he said, looking straight into his friend's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
eyes, "that this is my last night on earth. I have
a conviction that I won't see another sun rise."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said young Lingard, beginning to
feel creepy. "Don't talk like that, old man;
you'll unnerve me. You're not going to die."</p>

<p>"Why should I unnerve you, my boy?" asked
Mackenzie very quietly and gently. "There's nothing
to be afraid of in dying. I can face death
with perfect calmness; and I know I'm to die very
soon."</p>

<p>There was silence for some moments. Suddenly
Mackenzie started, turned in a listening attitude, and
put up a hand in warning.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear them?" he whispered. "Don't
you hear them? There are Maoris moving in the
bush below. I heard the pat of a naked foot just
now and the breaking of a twig."</p>

<p>The young leader of the scouts listened with
utmost intentness for the next few minutes. The
two comrades could hear each other's hearts thumping,
so still they crouched. But not another sound
came except the occasional call of the melancholy
morepork.</p>

<p>After a little while Lingard bade Mackenzie
good-bye for the time, and, with his carbine at the
"ready," crept back along the track and visited
the other men. Joining Maling, he told him of his
strange conversation with Mackenzie.</p>

<p>"He's a real good fellow," said Maling, "a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
comrade. I hope that presentiment of his is all
bunkum. But if he says there are Maoris moving
in the bush, we'll have work before morning."</p>

<p>In half an hour's time Lingard went the rounds
again, stopping every now and then to listen for
sounds of the enemy. He found Mackenzie still
reading, bare-headed, by the clear moonlight in his
little nook in the fern. Mackenzie's mate was
sound asleep.</p>

<p>The old soldier's senses were wonderfully acute.
Quietly as Lingard stole up on his moccasined feet,
he had heard him. He was listening while he read.</p>

<p>"Lingard," he said, "I've been reading for the
last time. I know it's my last night of life. To-day
I was so sure of this that I settled my account
at the canteen, and paid my last instalment on a
horse I bought from John Handley, and I've written
to my wife. I won't see to-morrow's sun rise.
This came to me yesterday morning.</p>

<p>"Lingard," he went on again, in a whisper,
"there are Maoris about! Can't you smell them?
They're in the bush below, waiting. But you'll
stay, I suppose, till daylight, unless something
happens before then."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Lingard, after vainly listening
for sounds in the bush, cautiously rose and walked
back along the track. He left Mackenzie sitting
there, with the moonlight streaming down on his
earnest face, still reading his little book. Returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
to Maling, Lingard sat with his companion listening,
until it was within perhaps half an hour of full daylight.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, they heard a fearful sound. A
rifle shot, followed instantly by a terrific yell, the
war-yell of the Maoris from the bush behind them.
The bush flashed fire, the flashes of many guns,
accompanied by reverberating bangs; then the
pattering and thudding of many naked feet along
the track.</p>

<p>The ambuscade had been unmasked. One of the
scouts&mdash;so it was learned afterwards&mdash;had cautiously
worked his way down the valley, far enough
down to see that the bridge over the Okehu had
been set on fire, and by its light he saw a large
party of armed Hauhaus. He hurried back to give
his comrades warning, but before he could reach
them some of the prowling natives discovered
Mackenzie and Williamson and fired on them,
wounding Williamson in the back when he started
to run.</p>

<p>The scouts had done their work, but would they
ever reach the camp alive?</p>

<p>The whole of the war-party were on the white
men's heels, racing through the fern and along the
narrow track and firing as they ran. The moon
had gone down, and it was too dim to see very far,
but the dawn was spreading over the eastern sky.</p>

<p>"They're on us!&mdash;they're on us!" exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Maling. "It's no use to run now; we wouldn't
have a show. Let's hide here in the fern."</p>

<p>The scouts were crouching in the fern within a
yard or so of the Maori track. The fern was very
high here, over a tall man's head in height, and was
very thick and matted, and lying in a slanting
direction. The two men, knowing that it was certain
death to venture out, for the Maoris were rushing
along the track in force, crept underneath the thick
masses of ferns, and pushed it up over them so that
they had room to move and were perfectly screened
from the enemy's eyes in that early morning light.
They made ready their Terry carbines, bit their
cartridges ready for reloading, and put their percussion-caps
in their mouths for instant use. Just
before they did so, Maling turned to his companion
and said:</p>

<p>"Lingard, old man, promise me if it comes to
the worst you won't leave me, and I'll do the same
by you. Don't let us leave each other," and he
put out his hand.</p>

<p>The young leader of the scouts gripped Maling's
hand. "We'll stick by each other," he said.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a thundering rush
of feet past the very muzzles of their carbines. A
mob of Hauhaus, yelling and shouting, raced past
them, following up the leaders who had been fired
on by the scout, and who had come dashing after
the white men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>The two hidden scouts could hear nothing of
their comrades, but they well knew the odds were
greatly against any of them reaching the camp.</p>

<p>Presently they heard firing from the direction of
the camp. The troops had turned out on hearing
the shots at the bush edge, and were covering the
retreat of the scouts.</p>

<p>Then another thing happened. Maling and his
companion heard and felt something now and then
swishing and cutting through the fern just above
their heads. They were under the fire of their own
comrades.</p>

<p>"Maling," said Lingard, "this is getting too
warm! It's not good enough to stay here and be
shot by our own men. Let's make a run for it."</p>

<p>Creeping out from their place of concealment, and
giving a quick look backwards to make sure that no
more Hauhaus were coming, the two scouts ran
along the track in the direction of the camp. Close
by on their left they could hear the enemy yelling
and firing.</p>

<p>Just as they turned a bend in the path they came
upon a terrible sight. Mackenzie lay on the
ground, face downwards; his head smashed in
and his brains spattering the ground. His carbine
and ammunition and Afghan sheath-dagger were
gone.</p>

<p>This they saw at one horrified glance, then they
dashed on, taking a short cut across the fern to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
camp. They could see the white tents now in the
morning light. They ran towards the troops shouting,
"Don't fire!&mdash;don't fire!"</p>

<p>The two scouts reached camp safely, and Lingard
immediately reported the result of the night's work
to the colonel. All the others excepting poor
Mackenzie turned up. One of them had fallen shot,
wounded in the back, close to the camp, but was
rescued by the surgeon, Dr. Walker, who pluckily
ran out and carried him in.</p>

<p>Mackenzie, one of the survivors said, was running
well, and would have escaped, but he suddenly fell
prone on his face without any apparent cause. A
Hauhau came running along next moment, and,
putting his gun close to Mackenzie's head, blew his
brains out.</p>

<p>Then came another strange development of the
morning's adventure. Surgeon Walker, on examining
Mackenzie's body, said he believed the scout
had died suddenly of heart disease, and that he was
quite dead before even the Hauhau shot him.</p>

<p>The brave old Gurkha soldier's presentiment of
speedy death was only too true a foreword from the
Unknown.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that this Hauhau ambuscade
had been unmasked. The camp was already astir,
and the troops were having their early morning
coffee, and in another half-hour would have begun
the march by the Okehu Gorge route, when the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
shots were fired. Once down in the narrow gorge
and the presence of the enemy undetected, they
would have been practically at the mercy of their
active and well-concealed foes in the thick bush
above and on either side of them.</p>

<p>After this little morning skirmish the Hauhaus,
numbering probably a hundred and fifty, quickly
retired through the bush to the Tauranga-ika <i>pa</i>,
taking with them as trophies the dead soldier's arms.
The white troops were soon on the move. Four
divisions of Armed Constabulary, the Volunteer
Cavalry, and the <i>Kupapa</i> Maoris marched through
the Gorge unmolested, and took up a position near
the great Hauhau <i>pa</i>, which Whitmore now prepared
to storm. First he tried artillery in an endeavour
to breach the stockade, and Kimble Bent
and his Maori comrades in the crowded fort now
stood target for cannon-fire.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE FALL OF TAURANGA-IKA</p>

<p class="blockquote">Shot and shell&mdash;The fort abandoned&mdash;Flight of the Hauhaus&mdash;The
chase&mdash;The fight at Karaka Flat&mdash;Mutilation of the dead&mdash;The
ambuscade at the peach-grove&mdash;The sergeant's leg&mdash;Rewards for
Hauhau heads.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Skirmishing</span> up over the fern slopes of Tauranga-ika
came Whitmore's Armed Constabulary and
Kepa's kilted guerillas from the Wanganui. Some
of the A.C.'s advanced to within about two hundred
yards of the stockade, and took cover in a ditch
which ran parallel with the front palisading; here
they opened fire. The main body had pitched
camp about half a mile from the <i>pa</i> front. At the
same time Armstrong guns were brought up and
posted on the left front of the stockade, and shell-fire
was opened on the rebel position at a range of
five hundred yards.</p>

<p>But most of the Hauhaus were safe in their
trenches and their covered ways, and the shells and
bullets passed harmlessly over them. A few of the
young bloods danced and yelled defiance from above-ground.
On the stockade was the Hauhau <i>tekoteko</i>,
the dummy figure which they worked in marionette-fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
by means of ropes that led into the trench
below. This dummy was intended to draw the
<i>pakeha</i> fire, but it had hardly deceived the veteran
A.C.'s and Kepa's <i>Kupapas</i>, versed in all Hauhau
ways that were dark and tricks that were vain.
Bent was underground, listening to the bang of
the Armstrongs and the whistle of the shells, and
now and again squinting through the palisades at
his adversaries.</p>

<p>One Maori, who was standing in an angle of the
<i>pa</i>, was wounded in the head by a splinter knocked
off one of the palisade-posts by a shot from an
Armstrong gun. The same shell, whizzing through
the <i>pa</i>, ripped a hole in Titokowaru's tent.</p>

<p>When night fell, no appreciable breach had been
made by the shell-fire. It was now decided to
storm the <i>pa</i> at daybreak. Some of the A.C.'s
crept up with their entrenching tools to within
fifty yards of the stockade, and dug out shelter-trenches.</p>

<p>The fort was remarkably quiet during the night.
It was reconnoitred when daybreak came, and
found&mdash;empty. The Hauhaus had for some mysterious
reason deserted it under cover of darkness,
and taken to the bush. So fell to the <i>pakeha</i> the
very strong Tauranga-ika <i>pa</i>.</p>

<p>Bent explains this unexpected abandonment of
Titokowaru's most formidable entrenchment.</p>

<p>The eternal feminine was at the bottom of it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief of blood and fire, with all his <i>mana-tapu</i>,
was vulnerable to the artillery of a dark
<i>wahiné's</i> eyes and soft <i>wahiné</i> blandishments. He
was detected in a liaison with another man's wife.
This misdemeanour was, in Maori eyes, fatal to his
prestige as an <i>ariki</i> and a war-leader. He had
trampled on his <i>tapu</i>, and his Hauhau angel, who
had so long successfully guided his fortunes, now
deserted him. His run of luck had turned.</p>

<p>A council of the people was held to discuss the
<i>cause célèbre</i>, and many an angry speech was made.
Some of the chiefs went so far as to threaten
Titokowaru with death. At length a chieftainess
of considerable influence rose and quelled the storm
of violent words. She appealed to the aggrieved
husband's people not to attempt Titoko's life; but
urged that the garrison should leave the <i>pa</i>&mdash;it
would be disastrous to make a stand there after
their <i>tohunga</i>, their spiritual head and their war-leader,
had lost his <i>mana-tapu</i>. This met with
general approval, and on the night of the attack
the people packed their few belongings on their
backs and struck quietly into the forest for the
Waitotara. Titokowaru, with forty warriors,
covered the retreat. "Afterwards," says Bent,
"when we had taken safe shelter in the Upper
Waitara, Titokowaru regained his <i>tapu</i> by means of
incantations and ceremonies performed by another
<i>tohunga</i>. But by that time the war was over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>So to the forest fled Titokowaru and all his people,
and hard on their trail, when the <i>pa</i> was found
deserted, came the A.C. scouts and Kepa's Maoris,
in lightest marching order for the chase.</p>

<p>The Government troops overtook the Hauhau
rear-guard at Te Karaka flat, on the descent to the
Waitotara River. At Te Karaka Major Kepa,
the fighting chief of the Whanganuis, was leading the
advance-guard of the pursuing force, when he was
hotly attacked by the Hauhaus who had planted
an ambush in the bush. Kepa was closely pressed.
Captain T. Porter, who commanded No. 8 Division
of Armed Constabulary&mdash;consisting of Arawa and
Ngapuhi Maoris, with a few good European bushmen&mdash;was
close up when Kepa was fired on, and he
promptly extended the supports across the flat.
Kepa, after a sharp hand-to-hand fight with the
enemy, burst through them and fell back on Captain
Porter. The <i>Kupapas</i> and their white comrades
fought the Hauhaus till dark, and had to
leave them dead and wounded on the field. Next
morning they found the mutilated bodies minus
hearts and livers, which the cannibal enemy had
cut out and taken away. The Hauhaus had also
beheaded one of the slain, a Whanganui soldier
named Hori Raukawa.</p>

<p>The grief of the friendly Maoris at this mutilation
of their dead was intense, and was given vent
to in weeping and furious threats. Kepa was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
in a terrible rage, and determined on retaliation in
kind.</p>

<p>This feeling was intensified a few days later,
when a strong force of Hauhaus ambuscaded and
slaughtered seven out of a party of ten white Constabulary
men at the Papatupu peach-grove on the
banks of the Waitotara River. The Constabulary
detachment was in charge of Sergeant Menzies of
No. 2 Division. The men, who belonged to Colonel
McDonnell's force at Te Karaka, had obtained leave
to forage for peaches in a grove at Papatupu, on the
opposite (north) bank of the Waitotara, and crossed
the river in a canoe. They were gathering the
fruit when a volley was suddenly poured into them
by a large body of Hauhaus, who were lying close
by waiting for <i>pakeha</i> game. They at once seized
their arms and rushed for their canoe, pursued by
two or three score of Maoris, led by Big Kereopa.
The rest of the story was told the author lately
by Tutangé Waionui, of Patea, he who had distinguished
himself in the repulse of the white troops
at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu the previous year. This is
Tutangé's account:</p>

<p>"I was one of the Hauhaus who ambushed the
Constabulary men, under Sergeant Menzies, at the
peach-grove at Papatupu. Some of them had got
into their canoe, and would have escaped, but the
others held on to it in an attempt to board it,
and so we caught and killed seven of them. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
sergeant was a big, tall man, and stout. I killed
him. He was stooping down at the time. I slew
him with no other weapon than a canoe paddle of
<i>manuka</i> wood. I snatched up a paddle from the
canoe and struck him a slanting blow on the side
of the temple with it, the fatal blow called <i>tipi</i>, as
delivered in sideways fashion with the edge of a
stone <i>mere</i>. The white sergeant fell, and a Maori
named Toawairere slashed off one of his legs with
a tomahawk. This was done for the sake of getting
the boot on the <i>pakeha's</i> foot for one of our men,
a one-legged fellow named Paramena, who wanted
the boot. The leg was taken away into the
bush."</p>

<p>Next day Colonel Whitmore sent the <i>Kupapas</i>&mdash;the
Maoris of No. 8 Division under Captain Porter
and the Whanganui under Kepa&mdash;across the river
in pursuit of the enemy, and Colonel McDonnell's
division of Constabulary followed them in support.
Porter and his men, during the skirmish which
followed, came across the fire in which Sergeant
Menzies' leg had been roasted. The remains of the
bone of the leg were there, and it was evident that
Big Kereopa<a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a>
<a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and his fellow-savages had once more
feasted on the flesh of the <i>pakeha</i>.</p>

<p>It was now that Colonel Whitmore agreed to a
request made by Kepa and offered rewards for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Hauhau heads. He said he would give £5 a head
for ordinary men and £10 for chiefs killed. This
gave a fillip to the bush-whacking chase, into which
the Government Maoris entered with ferocious zest.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">After</span> we deserted Tauranga-ika," says my old
<i>pakeha</i>-Maori, "we led a miserably rough life in
the bush. We were as near starvation sometimes
as we could well be. Kepa's <i>Kupapas</i> and the white
scouts were hunting for us, stalking us like wild
beasts, and we were hiding in the forest and living
on what we could pick up. We scattered in parties.
I and some of the Hauhaus selected a safe spot in
the deep bush, built <i>wharés</i> to shelter ourselves,
and then went out to the edge of the forest digging
up fern-root for food. We scoured the bush for the
<i>mamaku</i> fern-tree,<a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a>
<a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and cut out the white pith of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the tree; it was one of our principal foods at that
time. It has a peculiar effect on any one who eats
much of it&mdash;it makes him strangely drowsy and
sleepy. Sometimes, too, we had to eat <i>whara-whara</i>
and similar mosses, and the mushroom-like
<i>haroré</i> that grew on the <i>tawa</i>-trees, and <i>hakeke</i>, or
wood-fungus. We became very weak and feeble
for want of food. We did not dare to light a fire in
the daytime, for fear the smoke rising above the
forest trees would betray us. At night we would
kindle a small fire, just enough to keep the pipes
going as we sat round and smoked and talked in low
voices."</p>

<p>Titokowaru's warriors, too, ran short of ammunition.
For his cartridges, Bent sometimes had to
use small pieces of hard wood cut to the proper
size instead of lead bullets. The natives were also
often short of percussion-caps; they used to save
the exploded ones, and cut off match-heads and
insert them. A box of caps was a great prize to a
Hauhau in those days. This ingenious use of match-heads
was a common practice in the later days of
the war, and many a box of <i>pakeha</i> matches found
its way through supposedly "friendly" Maori
hands into the rebel camps.</p>

<p>For three or four weeks the Hauhaus concealed
themselves in the forests between the Waitotara and
the Patea Rivers, their warriors making occasional
sorties and laying ambuscades for straggling whites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only was Bent in daily and nightly danger of
death at the hands of his enemies, the Government
men, during this period of hiding and starving in
the bush, but in one of his adventures he narrowly
escaped the tomahawks of his own companions, the
Hauhaus.</p>

<p>Bent and a party of about twenty Maoris set out
one day from their camp at Oteka, away inland of
the Weraroa, on a food-hunting expedition into the
great trackless forests in the rear of their hiding-place.
They travelled half a day's journey into the
rugged bush-country, a lone region where no booted
foot had ever trod. They fished for eels in the
creeks, and climbed for wild honey wherever they
saw the bees buzzing round their hives in the hollow
trees. They carried with them <i>taha</i> (calabashes
made from the <i>hué</i>, or vegetable gourd); these they
filled with the honey. When they had collected
as much as they could carry, they started on their
return tramp to the <i>kainga</i>. Bent's <i>pikau</i>, or back-load,
consisted of about thirty pounds weight of
honey in <i>taha</i> and two large eels, all in a flax
basket.</p>

<p>When the party left their camping-place the
white man went on ahead, and was soon out of
sight of his companions. After a while he found
that he had missed the route by which he had come
the previous day.</p>

<p>He pushed on and on, hoping every moment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
catch sight of a broken branch or a footprint or a
tomahawk blaze on a tree that would indicate the
trail. He wandered about, up and down hill,
crossing creeks, and tearing what little clothes he
wore in the tangled bush, until he had not the least
idea where he was.</p>

<p>He was lost in the forest.</p>

<p>Night came on while the lonely white man was
still toiling bewildered through the dense woods.
He spent the hours of darkness crouched up under
a tree, sleeping little, and shivering with the cold,
for he was thinly clothed and had no blanket, and
no matches or flint and steel with which to light a
fire for warmth and cooking.</p>

<p>Early next morning Bent climbed a tall <i>rata</i>-tree
near his bivouac and scanned the wild country
round. Nothing but forest, forest everywhere&mdash;vast
waves of deep verdure sweeping away and
away as far as the eye could see. No sign of human
life&mdash;no guiding landmark. Somewhere beneath
that impenetrable pall of green that clothed everything
were his people. But where?</p>

<p>Ah! What is that blue, thin coil rising slowly out
of the forest far ahead, westward?</p>

<p>A curl of smoke! A Hauhau camp; perhaps
some hunting-party cooking their morning meal.</p>

<p>The white man joyfully descended from his tree-perch,
and quickly getting into his <i>pikau</i> straps
again, set out at as fast a pace as his load
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
would allow him, steering in the direction of the
smoke.</p>

<p>He toiled on and on, breaking through jungles
of undergrowth and clinging vines, over logs and
through watercourses, until suddenly he found himself
at the foot of a rocky wall which rose perpendicularly
above him for about thirty feet.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to clamber up the precipice,
assisting himself by the forest roots and creepers
which hung in trailing coils down its face, but they
gave way under his weight when he had ascended
but a few feet, and he found himself at the base of
the cliff again, debating whether to try the climb
again, or make a long detour, and perhaps lose the
run of the point for which he was heading.</p>

<p>Suddenly, high above him, a voice cried, "Who's
there?"</p>

<p>The startled white man, peering through the
tangle of foliage and creepers, saw a man standing
on the cliff-top&mdash;a Maori girt with a flax mat, a
gun in his hand. It was Rupé, his chief and
owner.</p>

<p>The Maori was gazing intently down the cliff.
With him was a woman, the old chief's daughter
Rihi, who was Bent's wife. He had heard the noise
made by Bent in his attempt to scale the cliff, and
he noticed the shaking of the bush-vines and
leaves that screened the lower part of the wall, but
the white man was so far hidden from his vision,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Bent called to him: "Don't fire, Rupé! It is
I, your <i>pakeha</i>&mdash;Tu-nui-a-moa!"</p>

<p>"<i>E tama!</i>" cried the old chief. "I am glad
indeed! I came out searching for you, for your
life is in great danger."</p>

<p>The <i>pakeha</i>, changing his position so that Rupé
could see him, explained his predicament.</p>

<p>"Remain where you are," said Rupé, "and I
will lower a rope to you."</p>

<p>In a few minutes a line, made of split leaves of
the <i>harakeke</i> flax, knotted together, and strengthened
with <i>aka</i>, or bush-vines, was thrown down the cliff
to Bent. The upper end of the hastily made bush
rope the old man had made fast to a tree on the
cliff-top.</p>

<p>"Send your <i>pikau</i> up first, and you can follow,"
ordered Rupé.</p>

<p>Bent tied his flax basket of eels and honey to the
line. Rupé hauled it up, lowered the line again,
and Bent tied it round his body below the arms.
Then the chief and his stalwart daughter hauled
the light-weight <i>pakeha</i> safely to the summit of
the wall.</p>

<p>Rihi and her father both wept as they took Bent's
hands, so great was their relief at finding their
<i>pakeha</i> safe and sound. Rupé told the white man
that he had feared he was dead.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Bent.</p>

<p>"Why? There are a score of armed Hauhaus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
searching the forest for you, and had they found
you before I did they would have killed you."</p>

<p>The old chief explained, further, that when Bent
did not return to the bush-village the previous
night, his fellow-eelers had come to the conclusion
that he had given them the slip on the journey
home, and had made off to the white men's camp.
So at daylight a party set out to scour the forest
round the <i>kainga</i>, fully intending, if they found the
deserter in hiding, to summarily execute him. Old
Rupé, too, had taken to the forest with his daughter&mdash;before
daylight&mdash;but for a different reason: he
did not believe his <i>pakeha</i> would desert him, and as
he concluded Bent had lost himself in the bush, he
had kindled a fire on the most prominent hillside
in the forest, in the hope that the wanderer would
see it and make his way towards it. His bush-craft
was successful, and no doubt it saved Bent's
life, for had he gone wandering on he would
most probably have run into the arms of his
hunters.</p>

<p>So the three of them&mdash;the <i>rangatira</i> and his
"tame white man" and the Maori girl&mdash;travelled
homeward as quickly and as quietly as they could,
seldom speaking to one another for fear some
prowling Hauhau should hear them. "Even now,
if they find you out in the forest," said Rupé, "I
may not be able to save you. Be cautious, for this
may be your last day!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the camp of the fugitive
rebels was reached, and Bent was safe.</p>

<p>Titokowaru, just back from a scouting expedition
to the forest-edge, was in the village. The
grim war-chief was genuinely pleased to see the
white man back again, and safe.</p>

<p>"<i>E tu!</i>" said he; "it was fortunate indeed that
Rupé met you in the forest. Had any of the others
found you&mdash;my young men of the <i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>&mdash;then
you had been a dead man!"</p>

<p>Now came an illustration of that many-sided law,
the <i>tapu</i>. Titokowaru took the two eels which Bent
had carried home on his back and hung them up
as an offering to the <i>atua</i>, the heathen gods. They
were under the ban because they had been borne
on the white man's back, which was temporarily
<i>tapu</i>; therefore they could not be eaten.</p>

<p>The honey, however, was not wasted. Titokowaru,
having no doubt a sweet tooth, sagely decided
that it would be sufficient to hang up the eels
for the gods; he <i>whakanoa</i>'d the honey, that is, he
repeated <i>karakia</i>, or incantations, over it, by which
the maleficent powers of the <i>tapu</i> were nullified or
averted and the food made fit for consumption.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<p class="center">A BATTLE IN THE FOG</p>

<p class="blockquote">The surprise of Otautu&mdash;An early morning attack&mdash;Kimble
Bent's dream&mdash;"<i>Kia tupato!</i>"&mdash;A gallant defence&mdash;Brave old
Hakopa&mdash;Flight of the Hauhaus.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">A misty</span> morning in the forest. A little Maori
hamlet, just a collection of thatched huts, in a
small clearing enclosed on all sides by the dense
woods. In the rear a deep ravine, jungly with
thick undergrowth, then the winding snag-strewn
Patea River. This was Otautu, Titokowaru's refuge-camp.
It stood on a plateau&mdash;now a richly
grassed farm; scattered over the clearing were
potato-gardens. There was a frail stockade of
stakes, but there were no trenches or rifle pits; it
was an ordinary residential <i>kainga</i>; the fugitive
Hauhaus trusted to the tangled forest as their best
defence.</p>

<p>Grey dawn. The raw morning fog hung low on
the sleeping village&mdash;a mist so thick that it shrouded
from the view objects even a few yards distant.
It lay like the winding bank of smoky mist that
marks the course of a forest stream early on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
summer morning; the black tree-tops stood out
clear above the white pall of damp, cold vapour.</p>

<p>Not a sound from the slumbering <i>kainga</i>, where
some three or four hundred Hauhaus&mdash;Kimble Bent
amongst them&mdash;lay packed in their <i>nikau</i>-roofed
huts.</p>

<p>At the edge of the clearing a solitary Maori
sentry, a man armed with a revolver, sat, keeping
a semi-somnolent guard.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the dark forest, appeared a
body of armed men. They came in Indian file;
they broke into a stealthy run as they left the
shadow of the trees; their bodies were bent eagerly
forward; they carried their rifles at the trail; they
uttered not a sound.</p>

<p>They were the Maori advance-guard of Colonel
Whitmore's expeditionary force of four hundred
A.C.'s and <i>Kupapas</i>. After weeks of bush-scouting
a Government column had at last happened on the
Hauhau hiding-place.</p>

<p>The Maori sentinel&mdash;he was a man of the Puketapu
tribe named Te Wareo&mdash;was all in an instant
wide-awake. The moment he jumped up he was
fired on by the advance-guard. Leaping into cover
he raced for the village, firing his revolver as he ran.</p>

<p>The discharge of the rifles rolled crashing through
the forest. Startled <i>kaka</i> parrots flew from their
tree-perches, screaming discordantly at their rude
awakening. The clear notes of a bugle rang out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
&mdash;it was the "Advance" and "Double!" The
active little colonel rushed his men up at top speed,
extended them, and advanced on the hidden camp,
and a strange combat began.</p>

<p>At the first crack of the firearms the <i>kainga</i> was
awake; and what a scurry there was! The Maoris
poured out of their <i>wharés</i> just as they leaped from
their sleeping-mats&mdash;some wearing only a shawl or
ragged mat; others entirely naked. Some of the
women rushed out of their huts without a shred
of clothing on, screaming and shouting, and running
for their lives. The men snatched up their guns and
tomahawks, and their cartouche-belts; and quickly
took post to defend their position, and give time
for their women and children to retreat in safety.</p>

<p>According to Kimble Bent the attack was not
entirely unexpected. At any rate, it had been foreshadowed
in Maori fashion by one of the Hauhau
"medicine-men."</p>

<p>"The day before this attack," says Bent, "I
had a strange dream, which Titokowaru's priest and
reader of dreams interpreted as an omen of misfortune.
I dreamt that I saw a strange Maori
village in which each house was cut in two length-ways,
leaving only half the dwelling standing, in
the shape of a shed or lean-to, such as we called
<i>tiheré</i>. I described this vision to the Hauhau seer.
He gathered the people in the meeting-house that
night, and after speaking of the dream I had had,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
he cried in a loud voice to them these words of
caution and warning:</p>

<p>"<i>Kia tupato! He po kino te po; he ra kino te ra!</i>"
("Be on your guard! This is a night of evil and
danger, and the morrow also will be a day of evil!")</p>

<p>"The prophet then said to me: 'Be ready for
flight in the morning! Get your belongings ready
packed in your kit, and, if you hear a suspicious
sound, fly from the <i>pa</i> at once.'</p>

<p>"So, when the first shots were heard in the early
morning, I was ready to make a bolt for it. The
moment the alarm was given I jumped up from
my sleeping-place in one of the huts, grabbed my
kit, and bare-footed and with nothing on but my
shirt and an old piece of a tent-fly girt round my
middle, I ran to the bank at our rear, and jumped
down the cliff. I went tumbling and scrambling
down to the river, and then travelled up along the
banks for a considerable distance as fast as I could
go. All I had saved from Otautu was what I had
in my kit&mdash;some papers, a little money, needles and
thread, and so forth. As I ran up along the river
banks I fell in with some of our people. We went
on until we found a canoe tied up on the bank, and
we crossed the Patea in her, ferrying four across at
a time until all were safely over. Those who were
with me were non-combatants, like myself, mostly
women."</p>

<p>While the unarmed people of the camp were making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
good their escape, the Otautu clearing was the
scene of severe fighting. The Hauhau warriors
took post just at the edge of the little plateau
where the thickly timbered ground suddenly fell
away to the ravine at the rear. Sheltered by the
fall of the ground, they swept the clearing with
their rifles and smooth-bores. Some of them
climbed into the branches of the <i>rata</i>-trees and
delivered their fire; some extended in bush-skirmishing
order on either flank; and both sides&mdash;<i>pakeha</i>
and Maori&mdash;peppered away briskly at each
other for half an hour or more.</p>

<p>It was a singular skirmish, for the dense fog still
shrouded the hill-top; and the Government men,
who were being punished severely by the Hauhau
fire, could for a long time see nothing of their
enemies. Many A.C.'s dropped, some shot dead.</p>

<p>The Government Maoris, the <i>Kupapas</i>, under the
celebrated Kepa, advancing from tree to tree round
the edge of the clearing, came to close quarters
with the Hauhaus. One of Titokowaru's veteran
warriors performed a deed here which is still told
and retold with loving admiration by the old
Taranaki Hauhaus.</p>

<p>He was the old man Hakopa (Jacob) te Matauawa,
the Maori who had taken a friendly interest in
Kimble Bent at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu, and saved the
white man from the two savages who stalked him
there, as narrated in a previous chapter. Hakopa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
was a tall, athletic man, of spare frame, and well
tattooed. He was about seventy years of age, a
true type of the olden Maori <i>toa</i>&mdash;the hero of the
war-trail, the brave. He was a curious figure, in
his military cap, tunic, and trousers&mdash;stripped from
a dead Constabulary man after the fight at Papa-tihakehake.</p>

<p>Hakopa dodged from tree to tree out on the
flanks of the clearing, making good use of a recently
captured carbine. In the uncertain light it was
difficult for the Government men to tell friend from
foe, and Hakopa's <i>pakeha</i> uniform seems to have
completely deceived some of the <i>Kupapas</i>. As he
leaped from tree to tree and stump to stump, he
shouted "<i>Raunatia! Raunatia!</i>" ("Surround
it!") to induce the belief that he was one of the
Government force.</p>

<p>At last all Hakopa's cartridges but two were gone.
A prudent warrior would have retired at this stage&mdash;but
not Hakopa. He did not like the idea of
retreat while he had a shot in his locker, and he
determined to bag something in the way of a
<i>Kupapa</i> or a <i>pakeha</i> with his last charges. He waited
until the leading men of Kepa's party were within
close "potting" distance, and, as one of them unsuspectingly
approached him, he quickly threw up his
gun and put a bullet into his enemy, then turned and
bounded into cover, and rejoined his comrades in
the defile, unhurt, hugely delighted with his exploit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"You young men waste your cartridges," he
said reprovingly, after the fight, to some of the
youthful braves of Ngati-Ruanui. "Look at me!
I know the worth of good powder and lead too
well to fire them away for nothing. For every
cartridge I used I hit a man!"</p>

<p>It was a determined, plucky stand, that defence
of the Otautu clearing by Titokowaru's warriors.
Every minute they held out, they knew, was giving
their women and children and old people a better
chance of safety.</p>

<p>At last the fog lifted, swept away from the clearing
by the morning breeze, and the sun shone out.</p>

<p>Now for the first time the Government soldiers
saw the village. The bugle sounded the "Advance"
again, and at the double the A.C.'s swarmed
into the empty <i>kainga</i>, to find, to their astonishment,
that it was neither rifle-pitted nor parapeted.</p>

<p>The Hauhaus, their resistance broken, took to
the forest, racing down the steep gully in rear of
the village and up along the banks of the Patea.
Kepa's Maoris went in hot pursuit, and shot two
or three of the fugitives. The main body crossed
the Patea safely, and rejoined their womenfolk and
children, camping, hungry, weary, and with limbs
and body torn and bruised in their flight, in a well-hidden
nook deep in the forest on the north bank
of the river.</p>

<p class="center">THE HEAD-HUNTERS</p>

<p class="blockquote">The skirmish at Whakamara&mdash;Hauhaus on the run&mdash;Government
head-hunters&mdash;Major Kemp's white scout&mdash;Sharp work in the
bush&mdash;Barbarism of the Whanganui&mdash;<i>Kupapas</i>&mdash;Smoke-drying the
heads&mdash;A present for Whitmore&mdash;The heads on the tent floor&mdash;End of
the war.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">The</span> deep and roadless forest was now the scene of
sharp, barbaric war. The Hauhaus, after the abandonment
of Tauranga-ika, built no stockades, but
trusted to their most ancient of refuges, the
<i>nehenehe-nui</i>, the great woody wilderness. From
one hiding-place to another they fled, with the
Government bush-fighters on their heels.</p>

<p>"After our surprise and defeat at Otautu," to
continue Kimble Bent's narrative, "we were safe
neither night nor day. Even when far in the depths
of the bush we were always on the look-out for
danger, for we never knew when we might have a
sudden volley poured into our midst. Kepa and
his friendlies were continually scouring the country
for us. We retreated north and west through the
forest till we reached a settlement called Whakamara.
Two nights we were on the track; all we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
had to eat was a couple of potatoes each. At
Whakamara we found many pigs, and were able
to fill our stomachs once more.</p>

<p>"But early one morning the soldiers were on us
again. Two of our men, young Tutangé and the
warrior K&#257;tené Tu-Whakaruru, who were out scouting
on horseback, discovered the troops lying in
ambush just outside, waiting to attack the village.
They turned and galloped back to us, Tutangé
waving his sword and whacking his horse along
with the flat of the blade.</p>

<p>"So off we went again, running for our lives,
with Whitmore's troops close behind us, firing as
they ran. Titokowaru and all his men fled, after
a very short fight. We took to the bush just like
wild pigs racing before the hunters. I and a few
others kept together, running for all we were worth,
half-naked, foodless, tumbling over logs, scrambling
in and out of creeks, and made no halt until we
found ourselves once more at Rimatoto, my old
home of 1866."</p>

<p>From Whakamara village the Maoris fell back on
a little fortified <i>pa</i> in the rear of the camp. This
position they abandoned after a brief skirmish, and
then the forest chase began. Whitmore ordered an
immediate pursuit, and a flying column of sixty
white Armed Constabulary, under Captains Northcroft
and Watt, and about one hundred and forty
Maori <i>Kupapas</i>, under Major Kepa and Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Thomas Porter, all in light marching order, took
to the bush after the retreating enemy.</p>

  <div class="caption">A CONSTABULARY OFFICER IN BUSH-FIGHTING COSTUME.<br />
   (<i>From a photo of Colonel T. Porter's taken in 1869.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>The advance-guard of the pursuing force numbered
twenty-five Maoris, about equally divided
between the Whanganui and Arawa tribes. Captain
Porter was the only European officer with
them, but one or two white scouts and bushmen
accompanied the Maoris. As the column's march
was necessarily in single file through thick and
tangled bush, it was difficult to bring a large number
of men into action when any skirmish or ambuscade
occurred, and the consequence was that practically
all the fighting was done by the advance-guard.</p>

<p>It was a picturesquely savage chapter of the war,
that chase of Titokowaru and his scattered Hauhaus.
There was more than a touch of the barbaric
in it, for some of the Government forces reverted
to the primitive war-methods of the Maori himself.</p>

<p>Between the moccasined hero of the war-trail
in Fenimore Cooper's and Captain Mayne Reid's
romances of Red Indian days, and Kepa's Maori
guerilla and some of his white comrades, there was,
after all, only this difference: one took the trail
hunting for scalps, the other for heads!</p>

<p>As mentioned in a previous chapter, Colonel
Whitmore had agreed to a request made by Major
Kepa after the fighting on the Waitotara, and had
offered rewards of £10 a head for Hauhau chiefs
killed and £5 for ordinary men. Kepa's <i>Kupapa</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Maoris, recruited from the Whanganui, Ngati-Apa,
Ngati-Raukawa, and other "friendly" tribes&mdash;only
friendly to the <i>pakeha</i> by reason of their deadly
animosity to the Taranaki tribes&mdash;were little less
savage than the Hauhaus themselves, and this manhunt
under the <i>mana</i> of the Government was just
the work that delighted them. They were "stripped
to a gantlin'" for the bush chase&mdash;simply a waist-mat
or shawl and cartridge-belts and a pouch for
their percussion-caps. And some of the white
bushmen-scouts were just as eager on the head-hunting
trail, and added to their service arms a
tomahawk.</p>

<p>With the Whanganui men marched a European
scout and bushman about whom some remarkable
stories are told. This was Tom Adamson, Kepa's
<i>pakeha</i>-Maori, a big, powerful fellow who surpassed
the Maoris themselves in bush-craft and endurance.
He marched bare-footed, like his Maori comrades.
Another of the white scouts and Hauhau-hunters
was a man who, in after years, became celebrated
for his pioneer exploration work in the vast wilderness
of Milford Sound, an old John-o'-Groat's sailor
and soldier named Donald Sutherland, whose name
has been given to the immense waterfall that is one
of New Zealand's natural wonders.</p>

<p>It was a wild, picturesquely unkempt column,
that little armed force of <i>pakehas</i> and Maoris, as it
filed off under its active and daring young officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
into the gloomy, danger-haunted woods, the unknown
and trackless forest through which the Patea
and its tributaries flowed. The bush-fighting costume
of many of the whites as well as Maoris was
simple, not to say brigand-like. Officers and men
of the Constabulary and other corps who had to
do much bush-marching discarded the trousers of
civilisation and took to the "garb of old Gaul,"
worn alike by the Scottish Highlander and the
Maori; this kilt was usually a coloured shawl,
strapped round the waist and falling to the knee.</p>

<p>Through the huge and tangled woods they
scrambled&mdash;hunters and hunted. Now along some
narrow trail, hardly discernible to the untrained
eye; now crawling through networks of supplejacks
and brambly shrubs and great snaky lianes
that looped tree to tree in bewildering coiled intricacies.
Down into steep and narrow watercourses,
swinging down one after another by the
hanging vines and tough tree-creepers; up rocky
gorges and jungle-clad cliffs. For endless miles
upon miles the great solemn woods covered the
face of the rugged land; beneath the shadows of
the thick, dark foliage loped the blood-avengers.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the first day of the chase
the column descended into a deep, thickly wooded
gorge. Suddenly from both sides a fire was opened
upon the centre of the force, the main body of the
A.C.'s. "Clear the bush!" was the order. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
advance-guard and A.C.'s quickly circled round and
enfiladed the enemy, who bolted like Red Indians
through the thickets; and the chase went on.</p>

<p>Three Hauhaus were shot and decapitated on the
first day of the chase. Every man killed, in fact, on
this and the succeeding days of the pursuit had his
head cut off.</p>

<p>The first Maori decapitated was a young chief,
who was shot while in the act of climbing a steep
cliff in the bush. Being a <i>rangatira</i>, his was a
£10 head. This man was a prominent Hauhau
named Matangi-o-Rupé. He belonged to Titokowaru's
own immediate clan, or <i>hapu</i>, Ngati-Manu-hiakai&mdash;"The
Tribe of the Hungry Bird." It was
a Ngati-Raukawa soldier in Kepa's contingent who
took off the Hauhau's head with his tomahawk;
later he duly delivered it at the <i>pakeha</i> camp.
Matangi's son, Kuku&mdash;now living at the village of
Taiporohenui&mdash;on learning of his father's fate, swore
to have <i>utu</i>&mdash;revenge&mdash;and vowed to Bent that if
he ever encountered the man who beheaded his
parent, he would "slice him to pieces like a piece
of beef."</p>

<p>Some years after the war, Bent, while on a visit
to a Maori settlement at Oroua, in the Manawatu
district, met this Ngati-Raukawa head-hunter&mdash;"an
ugly, tattooed old villain," as he describes him.
The <i>pakeha</i>, by way of imparting an interesting bit
of news, informed the old warrior of Kuku's threat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
but the tattooed veteran only smiled. The days
of the <i>lex talionis</i> were over. That <i>utu</i> account has
not been squared; but only because of the inconveniently
peaceful rule of the <i>pakeha</i>. Kuku has
by no means forgotten or forgiven the man who
sold his father's head to the white man.</p>

<p>Later on in the bush chase the advance-guard,
hurrying along at the double, came upon a Hauhau
family&mdash;a grey-haired, middle-aged man, his wife,
and two or three children. They had not been able
to travel so fast as their friends, on account of the
tired children, and so had been left behind. The
old warrior was fired on by one of the Arawa Maoris,
and was severely wounded. He fell, but struggled
to a squatting position, with his empty gun across
his knees. The Arawa rushed at him, with tomahawk
raised, to finish him off. The old Hauhau
sprang up with a great effort, gripping his tomahawk.
He was too badly wounded, however, to
strike a blow, and the Arawa seized him and his
tomahawk. Just at that moment a white man,
dressed like a Maori in a waist-shawl, and bare-footed,
rushed up, tomahawk in hand. He seized
the Hauhau by the hair, and, with a couple of
furious strokes, chopped off his head, and dropped
it, all bloody as it was, into the flax kit he carried
slung at his back, and in which there were already
other heads.</p>

<p>The Arawa by no means liked being done out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
of what he considered was his head, seeing that
he had captured the Hauhau, and there was a
savage squabble between the two as to its ownership.
The white man "bluffed" the Maori out of
it, however, and prepared to add the heads of the
rest of the family to his collection. He rushed at
the weeping <i>wahiné</i> and her children, and their
heads would have come off also had not Captain
Porter, fortunately for them, just come up. The
poor, terrified woman clung to his knees, beseeching
him to save her and her children. He told them
they would be safe, and ordered the white scout
forward. The Arawas took charge of the widow
and her children, and she was sent to Rotorua when
the campaign was over.</p>

<p>The Whanganui <i>Kupapas</i> were fully as savage as
any wild rebel. No quarter was given to any
Hauhau warrior, and no Hauhau thought of asking
for any mercy. Of one frightful scene Porter was
an eye-witness. After killing and beheading two
or three men in a little valley in the forest, the
Whanganui Maoris tied flax ropes to their ankles
and hung them up to the branches of the trees,
eviscerated them and thrust sticks into them to
keep them open, just like animals in a slaughter-yard.
Then they danced round the bodies like
fiends, flourishing the tattooed heads of the dead
by their long hair and shouting and yelling war-songs,
and making the hideous grimaces of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
<i>pukana</i>. They were quite beyond control, mad
with the lust of killing.</p>

<p>Porter at last managed to put a stop to this
mutilation, but he was powerless to prevent the
head-taking, except so far as his own men were
concerned. He did not allow any Arawas to decapitate
an enemy, much as some of the warriors
from the Hot Lakes Country would have liked to.
He asked the Whanganui natives to bury the heads,
and, if necessary, take only the ears with them if
they wished to claim Whitmore's reward. But the
warriors answered, "No, Witimoa said 'heads,'
and if he doesn't get the heads he may not pay us."</p>

<p>The pursuit of the Hauhaus continued for several
days, until Titokowaru's warriors finally scattered
in the dense forest, and the pursuers had exhausted
their food. It was then determined to make for
the coast again, but owing to the density of the
bush the Government men lost their bearings.
They were far in the tangled, jungly forest, without
a guide, for they had killed their prisoners. The
column accordingly divided, each division marching
independently for the open country, food, and
tented camps.</p>

<p>The night before the divisions of the pursuing
column separated, Major Kepa ordered one of his
<i>tohungas</i>, a wild-looking, tattooed old warrior,
learned in all the savage arts of Maoridom, to
<i>whakapakoko nga upoko</i>, that is, to dry or preserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the heads of the slain Hauhaus. Porter and the
other Europeans in the Maori contingents now for
the first time witnessed the ancient process of smoke-drying
human heads. The heads had up to this
time been carried in flax kits on men's shoulders
through the bush, and it was necessary, if they were
to be taken out to the camp, that they should be
preserved from decay.</p>

<p>The old medicine-man went into the bush and
returned with armfuls of branches of the <i>mahoé</i>-tree,
and made a fire, which he kept burning until all the
wood was reduced to glowing embers. The earth
was heaped up around this fire, and the head, neck
downwards, was placed over it, and all openings at
the sides were closed, so that the fumes from the
charcoal oven would pass up into the head. The
brains had previously been removed and the eyes
stuffed up. As the smoking went on, the old man
smoothed down the skin of the face with his
hands to prevent it wrinkling and wiped off the
moisture, until the head was thoroughly smoke-dried
and quite mummified. For several hours the
head-smoking went on, and in the morning the
trophies of the chase were packed for the final
march.</p>

<p>Half-starved, ragged and weary, the Constabulary
and their Maori allies at last reached the open
country; from the top of the range of wooded hills
they had seen the white tents of Colonel Whitmore's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
headquarters at Taiporohenui. That evening they
were in camp, and there they enjoyed the first
square meal they had had for days. Kepa and
Porter and their contingents had been nine days in
the bush.</p>

<p>Captain Porter went to Colonel Whitmore's
quarters as soon as he arrived, and reported the
result of his expedition. While he was giving the
commanding officer an account of the forest chase,
the Whanganui men who had taken the Hauhau
heads came up in a body and opened the tent door,
and poured in head after head upon the ground,
exclaiming as they did so, "<i>Na, Witimoa, to upoko</i>!"
("There, Whitmore, your heads!")</p>

<p>The little colonel was thunderstruck. He stared
with consternation in his eyes on the ghastly heads,
most of them tattooed, with grinning teeth and
long blood-stained hair, strewn about the floor
where they had rolled. There were eleven of them,
some at the colonel's feet, some beneath the table;
some had rolled under the camp bedstead.</p>

<p>He had forgotten all about his promise of a reward
for heads. Anyhow, he now told the Maoris,
he did not mean that the heads should actually be
brought in to him in camp, but that a reward would
be paid for each Hauhau killed in the pursuit. But
he kept his word to Kepa, and each head was paid
for.</p>

<p>The white scouts, too, brought in their kits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
heads, and received their blood-money. These and
certain other Taranaki heads brought in were not
personally delivered, but were all paid for, mostly
in orders for clothes, boots, and other necessaries.</p>

<p>"No more heads," was the colonel's order. He
realised that this barbarous fashion of squaring
affairs with the enemy would arouse a howl of condemnation
from those who did not understand the
sharp and savage necessities of frontier-fighting.</p>

<p>These facts may not please the mild or gentle
variety of reader. The idea of a New Zealand
Government force decapitating its enemies and
smoke-drying those heads for purposes of reward is
too, too savage for the refined humanitarian to
contemplate without a shudder. Nevertheless, these
are facts. Many an ugly incident happened in the
bush-fighting of those days. It was no kid-glove
warfare. In this case the Government Maoris were
inflamed by anger and revenge, and indeed some
of them were little better than the cannibals they
were chasing. And they were wild with a desire
to <i>ngaki mate</i>, that is, to seek vengeance, payment,
for their dead&mdash;blood for blood.</p>

<p>But while it was barbarous, it was thoroughly in
accord with the spirit of guerilla warfare that was
forced upon the troops, and it served its purpose,
for it struck terror into the hearts of Titokowaru's
warriors, and they never fought again.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hauhau war-chief's <i>mana-tapu</i> was gone, and
there was nothing for it but to fly to the depths of
the wilderness. He and his men gathered in a few
days at Rimatoto, but made a very short stay there.
They marched through the forest to the island-fastness
in the Ngaere swamp, where they were very
nearly caught by Whitmore and his Constabulary,
who made a rough <i>tête-de-pont</i> over the quaking
morass with hurdles of supplejack and bush-vines.
Then they made off for the Ngatimaru Country, on
the upper waters of the Waitara, thirty or forty
miles away, over terribly rough country and through
an almost trackless forest.</p>

<p>"A party of forty or fifty of us," says Bent,
"remained in our little settlement at Rimatoto,
always on the alert against surprise by the troops,
until the anxiety of our position became too much
for us. We packed up our belongings, and swagged
them inland to Rukumoana, on the Patea River.
In this lonely spot, far in the bush, we camped, and
made a little clearing in order to plant food. When
we had felled the bush with our axes, twenty men
travelled across to the Upper Waitara to procure
seed potatoes from their friends, and we planted
our crops and waited."</p>

<p>In this remote valley of refuge, far in the forest,
the white runaway and his Hauhau companions&mdash;he
was still with his chief Rupé&mdash;remained for many
weeks, living the loneliest life conceivable, hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
nothing of the outside world, and existing precariously
on the foods of the forest.</p>

<p>Titokowaru was safe in his bush retreat in the
Ngatimaru Country, his last battle fought, his once
godlike <i>mana</i> in the dust.</p>

<p class="center">THE LAND OF REFUGE</p>

<p class="blockquote">The flight from Rukumoana&mdash;Retreat to the Waitara&mdash;The Kawau
<i>pa</i>&mdash;Life in the Ngatimaru Country&mdash;Rupé and his white man&mdash;a
Maori Donnybrook fair&mdash;a tale of a <i>Taniwha</i>.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day two Hauhaus, exhausted and half-starved,
entered the little bush-camp at Rukumoana. One
of them was Bent's old <i>rangatira</i>, Tito te Hanataua.
They had passed through many perils and hairbreadth
escapes, and they warned the white man
and his Maori comrades that Kepa te Rangihiwinui
and his Whanganui Maori scouts were still hunting
for them, and would have their heads to a certainty
should they happen on the trail to the refuge place.</p>

<p>The old feeling of terror came over Bent and his
companions at the mention of Kepa's name. That
night Hauhau piquets kept watch on the edge of
the clearing, and more than once they imagined
they heard stealthy footfalls, the breaking of
branches, and the whispers of enemies in the woods.
These dangers, however, were things of the imagination.
Nevertheless, it was an anxious night in the
lonely <i>kainga</i>, and when morning came the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
decided to abandon their camp and bury themselves
still deeper in the wilderness.</p>

<p>In a very short time the men and women of the
settlement were on the march, laden with their
flax <i>pikaus</i>, containing such belongings as they
thought worth removing. They took to the forest
in a due northerly direction; bound for that
Alsatia of rebels and Hauhaus, the remote and
rugged Ngati-Maru Country, up on the head-waters
of the Waitara&mdash;Titokowaru's hiding-place.</p>

<p>The utmost caution was observed on the march.
No fires were lighted. So that there should be no
clue to the direction of the flight, care was taken
to leave no broken branches or other bushmen's
signs; not a leaf was turned or a twig displaced if
the refugees could help it until they were well into
the ranges. Wherever possible they took to the
creek-beds and walked in the running water, so
that no trail should betray them. They could have
spared themselves that anxiety and trouble, however,
for the Government troops had at last abandoned
the chase.</p>

<p>Two days Bent and his friends spent on that
terrible trail&mdash;the roughest, wildest part of the
Taranaki hinterland. Fording rivers, pushing
through matted jungles, climbing wooded precipices,
lowering their swags down perpendicular cliffs, and
swinging themselves down by forest vines and
creepers&mdash;they emerged at last, a weary little band,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
on the banks of the Waitara, about thirty miles
from the mouth of that river. All around towered
the densely forested blue ranges; the high banks of
the winding Waitara fell precipitously to its rapid-whitened
waters.</p>

<p>On the cliff-top where they left the forest there
was a little Maori camp. Here the fugitives were
ordered to the main Hauhau camp, the Kawau <i>pa</i>,
where Titokowaru and his followers had established
themselves, weary of war, but nevertheless resolute
to die "fighting like the shark," as the Maori has
it, if attacked in their last hiding-place.</p>

<p>The Kawau <i>pa</i> stood in an admirable position for
defence, in a great bend of the Waitara River. The
winding rapid river here swept round a long tongue
of steep-banked level land, protecting it on three
sides; in the rear was the dense forest. The banks
of the river were from twenty to thirty feet high,
and could be climbed only in a few places. On
this high tongue of land, about a quarter of a mile
long, there stood a large village of well-built <i>raupo</i>
and <i>nikau</i> thatched houses; between the village
and the forest were the cultivations of potatoes,
<i>kumara</i>, and <i>taro</i>. On the opposite side of the river,
in the direction of the Taramouku Range, wild
horses and cattle abounded in the bush. A short
distance below the village there was a large <i>pa-tuna</i>,
or eel-weir, consisting of two rows of stout <i>manuka</i>
stakes set closely together and sunk into the river-bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and converging in a <big><b>V</b></big>, at the lower end of
which <i>hinaki</i>, or eel-baskets, were set for the purpose
of catching the <i>piharau</i>, or lamprey, which
abounded in the Waitara, and which were a great
Maori delicacy.</p>

<p>As Rupé and his <i>pakeha</i> Bent and their companions
marched slowly into the <i>marae</i> of the war-chief's
camp, their eyes on the ground, they were
welcomed with the ancient ceremony of the <i>powhiri</i>.
The village women and girls waved green branches
and shawls as they retired before them, singing all
together the famous old greeting song, "<i>Toia Mai
te Waka!</i>" ("Oh, haul up the canoe!") likening the
guests to a canoe-party of visitors arriving from a
distant shore.</p>

<p>Then as the women fell back the whole force of
Titoko's warriors leaped to their feet, and swinging
their firearms this way and that, threw themselves
with martial fury into all the thrilling action of the
war-dance. The ground shook under the mighty
tread of many scores of brown feet, and the forest
rang with the chorus of the war-song and the reverberating
volleys of many guns. And then, when
the dance was ended, the <i>hongi</i> of long-severed
friends, the pressing of nose to nose, and the pitiful
weeping for the dead. For quite two hours the
great <i>tangi</i> lasted. When it ceased one of the head-men
of the river-tribes sent the new arrivals to his
own camp, close by the Kawau; the village women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
came in procession, to the lilt of the <i>tuku-kai</i> song,
bearing their baskets of food, steaming hot from
the <i>hangi</i>, and the half-starved white man and
his friends were soon enjoying a bountiful feast
after their long-enforced existence upon the meagre
rations of the bush.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Kimble Bent lived in this securely hidden place
of refuge, and at Paihau village, near by, from the
end of 1869 until about 1876. He was now a
Maori in all his ways; he planted food-crops and
harvested them, snared birds, fished for eels, cut
out canoes, and paddled his canoe on the river,
joined the Hauhaus in their songs and their
sacred chants, and danced with them in their
<i>hakas</i>; he wore as little clothing as any native in
the camp.</p>

<p>Life did not go too easily with the white man
during those days on the Waitara. He was still
Rupé's bond-servant; and his master and owner
sometimes took fits of ungovernable passion. In
one of these paroxysms of anger Bent had a
narrow escape.</p>

<p>Rupé one day ordered his white man to go down
to a creek, which ran into the Waitara near the
Paihau <i>pa</i>, and clear out the little dam in which the
household were accustomed to steep their Indian
corn, their <i>kaanga-pirau</i>. Bent was working away
cleaning out the steeping-pool when his chief came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
up and found fault with him because he was not
working hard enough. "I made him some answer
which didn't please him," says Bent, "whereupon
he flew into a terrible rage and rushed at me like a
tiger. I stooped and caught him by the leg, and he
fell into the muddy pool. Up he jumped in a
foaming passion, and ran to the <i>pa</i>, got out his gun,
and loaded it to shoot me. But his wife rushed at
him, took the gun out of his hands, and told me to
hurry down to the other village, where I would be
safe. So I ran to the river-bank, loosed a small
canoe, and paddled down the river to the lower
<i>pa</i>, where I was kindly received and taken into my
old friend Hakopa's house, and I lived and worked
there for some months."</p>

<p>Another incident of those wild old days on the
Waitara, narrated by Bent, is worth the telling, as
an illustration of the whimsically variable temper
of the Maori and of his truly Hibernian love of a
"free fight."</p>

<p>The war had long been over, and some <i>hapus</i> of
the tribes on the upper river talked of selling their
lands to the whites. Certain of the chiefs had
been down at Waitara township and in New Plymouth,
and there they had been approached by the
agents of the Government. In the end they sold
their lands for eighteenpence an acre. But the
more conservative of the Hauhaus stoutly held out
against land-selling, and against any dealings with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
the hated <i>pakeha</i>; and the difference of opinion
led to frequent quarrels.</p>

<p>One day a council of the people was held on the
<i>marae</i> of the Paihau village for the purpose of discussing
the land-selling proposals. Long and bitter
were the speeches; speaker after speaker <i>taki</i>'d up
and down the <i>marae</i>, and worked himself up into a
fury of excitement.</p>

<p>Two old chiefs, tattooed veterans of the war,
their long hair adorned with feathers, weapons of
wood and stone in their hands, angrily assailed
each other. One was Rupé, the other was Horopapera
Matangi. One advocated the sale of surplus
lands, the other vigorously opposed it, and
insisted on the principle of "Maori land for Maori
men." Then there arose a dispute about the ownership
of a <i>tangiwai</i> (greenstone pendant). From
argument they came to hurling abusive threats at
each other.</p>

<p>At last Rupé furiously hurled his weapon&mdash;a
sharp wooden spear&mdash;at Horopapera, who dodged
it, and cleverly caught it near the butt end as it
whistled past him. He instantly smartly returned
it to its owner, spearing him through the leg.</p>

<p>Next two women went at it. Women of rank
these, who considered themselves entitled to equal
debating voice with the men-folk. Their powers of
rhetoric and invective exhausted, they fell on each
other very literally "tooth and nail," biting, hair-pulling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
scratching, screaming. In their struggle
they tore each other's clothes off, and two nude
Amazons raged round the <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>One of the wild women, a young chieftainess, her
long hair streaming behind her, her pendant breasts
quivering, her shoulders bleeding, seized a canoe
paddle and struck her antagonist a blow across the
naked back with it. The other grabbed a <i>tokotoko</i>,
or walking-staff, and, thrusting it between her opponent's
legs, neatly up-ended her, in the "altogether,"
on the green <i>marae</i>.</p>

<p>By this time the whole tribe were into the battle,
with sticks, paddles, spears, and any weapon they
could lay their hands on&mdash;men and women alike.
It was a real faction fight. Fortunately, the people
had left their guns in their <i>wharés</i>, and were too
intent upon their hand-to-hand encounter to run
for their firearms.</p>

<p>Kimble Bent stood on one side watching the
squabble. He was close to the river-bank, where
the canoes were tied up. Presently, one of the
Maoris ran down to the water-side with an axe, and
began furiously cutting away at his antagonists'
canoes. Others ran to the cooking <i>hangis</i>, and with
burning sticks from the ovens set fire to some of the
thatched houses in the <i>kainga</i>. Soon there was a
pretty blaze, and half the village was burned down
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>In half an hour's time the people had cooled down,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and the trouble was over. Then&mdash;a Hibernian
people the Maoris, surely!&mdash;they began to weep
over their quarrel, and fell on each other's necks&mdash;or,
rather, pressed each other's noses&mdash;to make up
for the hard words and blows they had just exchanged,
and set to work to rebuild the dwellings
they had destroyed in their hasty anger.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Meanwhile, Titokowaru wearied for the trail
again, unable to rest in this secluded wilderness of
the Waitara. His <i>tapu</i> status had been restored
by a Waitara priest, with the appropriate <i>karakias</i>
and invocations. Gathering together a band of his
warriors&mdash;the remnant of the once ever-victorious
<i>Tekau-ma-rua</i>&mdash;he paraded them in the <i>marae</i> of
the Kawau <i>pa</i>, and farewelling his people, took his
old place at the head of the <i>taua</i> and led them off
in a grand war-dance. A truly savage figure, that
stern old chief, as he leaped to the van of his war-party
and danced, his sacred <i>taiaha</i> in the air; his
waist girt with a coloured shawl, a rich feather cape
of native make fastened over the left shoulder and
under the right; his grizzled head decked with
white plumes. And with loud cries of "<i>Haere, ra!</i>
<i>Haere ra!</i>" the villagers farewelled the great war-chief
as he marched his armed men out of the <i>pa</i>
and struck into the forest of the Taramouku, bound
for the open lands of South Taranaki and his ancestral
home. But it was no longer the war-trail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
for Titoko and his henchmen fought no more, but
betook themselves to the great camp of Te Whiti
the Prophet, who preached peace, and prophesied
sundry supernatural ways by which the Maori would
come into his own again.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The minds of these isolated forest-dwellers were
saturated with superstition, with strange beliefs that
were a reflex of the vast untrimmed places of
nature in which they lived. The white man, too,
almost came to believe in the tales of saurian-like
<i>taniwhas</i> and water-demons, in the <i>patupaiarehe</i>
and <i>maero</i>, the forest-fairies and forest-giants, in
the occult malevolence of the <i>tapu</i> and <i>makutu</i>
spells.</p>

<p>A story related by Bent is illustrative of the
Maori belief, up to quite modern days, in malignant
beings which made their homes in lonely waters and
in caves&mdash;the dreaded <i>taniwha</i>.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The tale of the "Taniwha" of the Kopua</i>:</p>

<p>One day&mdash;this was in the early "seventies"&mdash;an
old man named Te Maire left the Kawau landing
in his canoe, and paddled down the Waitara to a
place called Te Kopua, the site of an ancient village.
The object of his expedition was to procure dry
resinous strips of the <i>rimu</i>-pine for the purpose of
making torches to be used in catching <i>piharau</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
(lampreys) in the river at night. After getting the
wood he required he started on the return paddle
to his home. On the way to the Kawau he disappeared,
and was never seen again alive; no doubt
he overbalanced and fell into the river while poling
his canoe up one of the small rapids near the
Kopua.</p>

<p>That afternoon five men from the Kawau, including
Kimble Bent, were paddling their canoe down
the river to a settlement a few miles distant, when
they caught sight of the old man's empty canoe
drifting down with the swift current. As they approached
it it sped away rapidly before them, and
at last stranded on a shingle-bank in a bend of the
river. In it they found Te Maire's gun and a young
pig, which the vanished man had evidently caught
in the bush while on his torch-making expedition.</p>

<p>Bent's Maori companions immediately explained
in their own way the mystery of their tribesman's
disappearance.</p>

<p>"There is a <i>taniwha</i> there," they said, "a fearful
water-monster that dwells in a deep, still pool
under Te Kopua's banks. He has stretched forth
his long claws and dragged the old fellow down to
his den."</p>

<p>The Maori canoeists made haste to quit the dead
man's craft, and plied their paddles with unusual
energy until they reached their destination on the
shore below. They told their story, and that evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
a meeting of the village people was held in the
<i>wharepuni</i> to discuss the mystery.</p>

<p>For hours the wiseacres of the bush-hamlet
solemnly debated the circumstances, and each
canoeist in turn had to give his account of the affair
and advance his theory. At last it was decided
that there was no possible doubt that the <i>taniwha</i>
of the river had seized Te Maire and drowned him.
There must, of course, be a reason, for no <i>taniwha</i>
of any repute would take such an extreme step
without some good cause.</p>

<p>The verdict was that Te Maire had violated the
<i>tapu</i> of the deserted village; he had in all probability
taken some dry <i>rimu</i> from an old house that stood
there, and which was sacred because a chief had
died in it&mdash;goodness knows how long ago. The
river-god had very properly punished him with
death&mdash;it was the penalty of infringing the law of
<i>tapu</i>.</p>

<p>The next day and for some days thereafter canoe
crews hunted the river for the old man's body, but
found it not. At last a woman at the lower settlement,
on going down to the river one morning to
get a calabash of water, spied the body of the missing
man hanging in the branches of a prostrate
<i>kahikatea</i>-tree on the opposite side of the river,
about four feet above the water.</p>

<p>The question was, how did the body get there,
entangled in the branches that height above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
river, for there had been no flood, no noticeable rise
or fall in the level of the river.</p>

<p>The answer was plain to the mind of the Maori.
He summed it all up in two words:</p>

<p>"<i>Te taniwha!</i>"</p>

<p>The river-monster, after grabbing Te Maire from
his canoe and detaining him a while in his watery
grave, had dragged the body away down-stream
and hung it up in the tree-branches opposite the
village, so that the dead man's people should have
no difficulty in recovering it, and in giving it decent
burial.</p>

<p>A truly thoughtful and considerate <i>taniwha</i>!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<p class="center">BUSH LIFE ON THE PATEA</p>

<p class="blockquote">The return to Rukumoana&mdash;The forest-village&mdash;Bird-snaring and
bird-spearing&mdash;Bent the canoe-builder&mdash;His third wife.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last&mdash;about the year 1876&mdash;the Upper Waitara
was sold to the Government. The white man and
his Maori people cried their farewells to Ngati-Maru
and journeyed back over the ranges and through
the forests to their old lands in the valley of the
Patea. Bent was still Rupé's servant. The old
chief and his household and some Hauhau relatives,
armed, and carrying their belongings on their backs,
trudged through the wilderness until they reached
Rukumoana, their old-time shelter-camp on the
banks of the Patea, about thirty miles from the
sea. Here they halted and built their hamlet of
saplings and thatch, and an old overgrown clearing
was burnt off and planted with potatoes and maize.
The party was but a small one. Besides Bent,
there were Rupé, his wife, and their two sons; old
Hakopa and his wife; and their niece, a girl named
Te Hau-rutu-wai ("The Breeze that shakes the
Raindrops down").</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an even lonelier spot than the refuge-camp
in the Ngati-Maru country; life here was
simple and primitive in the extreme. The people
tended their little plots of food-crops, shadowed by
the dark forest; they snared and speared the forest
birds, they hunted the wild pig, and climbed the
hollow trees for wild honey. For nearly two years
the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori lived with his little tribe in Rukumoana.</p>

<p>The ancient customs of the Maori fowler's cult
were observed by these bush-dwellers, brown and
white. For instance, the first <i>kaka</i> parrot or <i>tui</i>
or other forest creature snared or speared in a day's
birding was not eaten, but was left, as an offering
to the gods of the forest, beside an old <i>tapu</i> canoe
which was lying in the bush close to the river-bank.
It was a hoary relic, this ancient <i>waka-tapu</i>, a
carved dug-out covered with long grey moss. It
was a small canoe, eight or ten feet long, and had
lain there for years and years filled with water.
Somewhat similar canoe-shaped troughs, filled with
water, stood in various places in the forest; these
were filled with water, and were generally placed
in spots remote from streams or pools. Above
them slip-knot snares were arranged, so that the
pigeons and <i>tui</i> and other birds, flying down to
quench their thirst after feeding on the <i>miro</i> or
<i>hinau</i> or <i>tawa</i> berries, were caught in the nooses,
and hung there, flapping and helpless, until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
fowlers went round to collect the day's bag. This
canoe was called a <i>waka-whangai</i>, or <i>wai-tuhi</i>.</p>

<p>When spearing birds with the long barbed spear
of <i>tawa</i>-wood, the hunter would take great care to
avoid getting any blood on his hands in withdrawing
the weapon from the bird's body. Should
blood stain the hands&mdash;"<i>kaore e mana te tao</i>"&mdash;the
spear would lose its bird-killing powers; it would be
an unlucky affair altogether, and the forest-man
might as well throw it away. Such were the beliefs
of the dwellers in those dim forest-places.</p>

<p>At the end of the first harvest season Rupé led
his white man out into the forest one day, and,
halting before a tall, straight <i>totara</i>-pine that grew
near the steep bank of the Patea, he said:</p>

<p>"This is my canoe! Hew it down and carve it
out! In it we will paddle down the river to Hukatéré,
and you shall look upon the faces of your
fellow-<i>pakehas</i> again."</p>

<p>So now behold Bent the canoe-builder. There
above him towered the tree&mdash;Tane the Forest-god
personified. In his hand was his broad-axe; with
it he must make his <i>rangatira's</i> river-boat.</p>

<p>He felled the tree, and, lopping off the upper part,
began the laborious work of dubbing out the <i>waka</i>.
The upper side of the trunk he levelled off with his
axe, and then he gradually cut it into hollowed
shape, an art he had learned on the Waitara. For
this portion of the work an adze was chiefly used,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
a steel blade lashed to a wooden handle in the old
Maori fashion. He trimmed and shaped the ends
into bow and stern, and day by day the canoe
assumed more shapely proportions, until at last it
lay complete&mdash;a craft of about twenty-five feet in
length and three feet in beam, rough and undecorated,
it is true, but still a ship of the Maori, fit to
carry cargo and paddlers, and run the rapids of the
swift and broken Patea. Ropes were made of stout
supplejack vines, and with Rupé and his family
the white man lowered the canoe down the high
bank to the water-edge. <i>Te Riu-o-Tané</i> lay ready
for its crew&mdash;the Hollow Trunk of Tané.</p>

<p>Then paddles were shaped out, and Bent and his
companions set to work catching and drying eels
and gathering wild honey, in preparation for the
voyage down the river to Hukatéré village, where
the main body of Rupé's tribe resided.</p>

<p>About this time the white man entered upon his
third matrimonial experience. His chief's granddaughter,
a good-looking girl of about eighteen,
came to the little village with a visiting party of
Ngati-Ruanui. She had already a husband, but
he had quarrelled with her, and attempted to kill
her; she, therefore, returned to her old <i>tupuna</i>,
Rupé, who now gave her to Bent; and the white
man and his young Maori wife lived happily there
in well-hidden Rukumoana.<a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a>

<p class="center">HIROKI: THE STORY OF A FUGITIVE</p>

<p class="blockquote">Hiroki, the slayer of McLean&mdash;Strange faces at Rukumoana&mdash;A forest
chase&mdash;A meeting and a warning&mdash;Hiroki's wild bush life and his
end.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than one outlaw from the white country outside
took refuge in the Taranaki bush even in those
<i>post-bellum</i> days. One of these was Hiroki, the
Maori who killed McLean. Hiroki ("The Lean One")
had quarrelled with a survey-party who had camped
on his land away out near the coast in the year
1878; the cause of the trouble, as he said, was
the killing of his pigs by McLean, who was the surveyor's
cook. Hiroki remonstrated with the
<i>pakehas</i>, but they jeered at him; and when his last
pig had disappeared he sat down and wept, then
loaded his gun, went to the survey camp, and shot
McLean dead. Wherefore he was a hunted man,
with a price on his head.</p>

<p>One day, as the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori (Kimble Bent) and
his Maori companions were sitting smoking in their
lonely little bush-village at Rukumoana, far up the
Patea River, they heard a loud hail across the river.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
They looked at each other in astonishment and a
little alarm, for they imagined that no one knew
their hiding-place. Bent went to his hut, and loading
a revolver, put it in his belt, then walked over
to the river-bank. On the other side of the stream
there were six natives standing. They called to
Bent to bring a canoe over and ferry them across.</p>

<p>Bent, always on the <i>qui vive</i> for danger, was
dubious about the wisdom of trusting himself alone
with a party of strangers, who, for all he knew,
might be after his head, for he was still an outlaw.
But he dropped into his canoe, and with a few strong
strokes sent the dug-out across the river. He knelt
in his canoe, holding her nose into the bank, and
interrogated the strange Maoris. The leader was
a tall young half-caste. They were all armed with
revolvers, and one or two had tomahawks stuck in
their belts.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from, and what do you
want here?" asked the white man.</p>

<p>"We have come seeking a man who has committed
a crime," replied the half-caste, speaking, as
Bent had done, in Maori.</p>

<p>Bent shoved the canoe a stroke off from the bank
and said determinedly, with a hand on his revolver:</p>

<p>"If you have come to capture me I will not be
taken; I will spill the blood of the first man who
attempts it. I will kill my enemy first and then
kill myself." ("<i>Ka maringi i ahau te toto a te tangata
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
tuatahi. Ka mate taku hoariri nei, maku e whakamate
toku tinana.</i>")</p>

<p>"It's all right, friend, we don't want you," said
the half-caste; "we are looking for a Maori called
Hiroki, who has murdered a surveyor's cook, named
McLean, out yonder on the plains. We have traced
him up here, and we want to know where he is,
because there is a price on his head, and we are
Government Maoris."</p>

<p>"Come along, then; I'll take you across," said
Bent. The strangers stepped into the canoe, and
the white man paddled them over the Patea; then
took them up to the village and into Hakopa's
house.</p>

<p>To the old chief and his Maori companions the
half-caste explained the mission that had brought
his party to lonely Rukumoana.</p>

<p>"We have not seen your man Hiroki," said
Hakopa. "He may have swum the river and passed
through here by night. Who knows? If he has
passed this way he has no doubt gone to Te Ngaere,
which is a very difficult place to reach and a good
refuge-place for men like Hiroki."</p>

<p>"We do not know the trail to Te Ngaere,"
said the half-caste. "Will any of you guide us
there?"</p>

<p>Bent offered to go as guide, saying he knew the
track to Ngaere very well and had frequently been
there in the war-days. "But," he asked, "will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
you guarantee my safety if I trust myself with
you? How do I know that you will not cut my
head off when you get me out alone in the bush,
and take it out to get the Government reward?"</p>

<p>The half-caste laughed. "You're quite safe,
<i>pakeha</i>. Not a man of us will touch you. I tell
you we only want Hiroki."</p>

<p>A young man named Pakanga, of the Ngati-Maniapoto
tribe from the King Country, happened
to be in the village on a visit to the forest-dwellers.
He was sitting alongside Bent. "Friend," he said
quietly, "I will go with you, and see that they don't
attack you treacherously."</p>

<p>So Bent agreed to go as guide, and, after a meal
of pork and potatoes, set before them by the women
of the <i>kainga</i>, the armed party of man-hunters set
out along the bush-track leading in the direction
of the swamp-defended Ngaere, the place where
Colonel Whitmore and his force of Colonial soldiers
just failed in surprising and capturing Titokowaru
in the last days of the war in 1869.</p>

<p>Bent leading, the party filed along the narrow
overgrown trail until they were close to the banks
of a small stream, the Mangamingi. A little distance
back from the creek the white man asked his
companions to halt, saying that he and Pakanga
would go on to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>The half-caste and his five men sat down and lit
their pipes, and Bent and the King Country Maori
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
went off cautiously, saying one of them would
come back at once if they caught sight of the fugitive.</p>

<p>The white man and his friend had gone only a
short distance when they came upon a fire burning
just alongside the track, in an old camping-place
beneath the shade of a giant <i>totara</i>-tree, whose great
branches overhung the little dark river that flowed
close by. A few roasted potatoes, still warm, lay
alongside the fire. Evidently it had been deserted
only a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Now," said Bent to his companion, "let us
settle quickly how we shall act. Hiroki&mdash;for it can
be no one else&mdash;must be close by; he must have
only just left this spot. Shall we betray him to
the Government, or shall we let him escape? He
had a just grievance against the man whom he shot.
We have heard all about it, and we know that he
was a peaceable man, who was provoked into a fit
of passion. He is a lonely and a hunted man, and
for me my sympathies are with him, for is he not
a fugitive like myself?"</p>

<p>"<i>E tika ana</i>," said the young King Country
Maori. "That's right. We won't give him up to
the Government head-hunters."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you now, friend," said Bent, "that
I have had suspicions for some days that Hiroki
has been in hiding near our village. One morning
lately, when I went to look in my <i>pataka</i> (store-house)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
across the river, where I keep my seed-potatoes
for the new season's planting, I found that
some of them had been taken. Then half a mile
up the river the next day I saw a place where some
stranger had been fishing for eels, for there were
heads of the eels lying there where he had cut
them off. There was a fire there, and some of my
seed-potatoes had been roasted in it. I told old
Hakopa and no one else about it."</p>

<p>The two men descended the bank to the river.
Just where the track entered the slow-moving,
muddy stream they saw the fresh prints of naked
feet. Wading across, they quickly mounted the
opposite bank and set out at a noiseless, easy lope,
their bare feet making hardly a sound, along the
trail that wound into the glooms of the bush.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at a turn in the track, they came upon
Hiroki.</p>

<p>The fugitive was standing there, waiting, for the
low growling of his dog, a white, savage-looking
animal, had given him warning of pursuit. The
hunted man menacingly presented a short-barrelled
gun at the <i>pakeha</i> and his companion. He was a
fellow of middle stature, lean, as his name implied,
but strong and hard-limbed, with a dark determined
face and a short black beard.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" cried Hiroki.</p>

<p>"Oh, nowhere in particular," Bent replied;
"just strolling along" ("<i>ki te haereere</i>").</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>The Maori looked puzzled and suspicious, and
kept his gun at the ready.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, friend," said Bent quickly; "you
are in danger. There are six Government Maoris
close behind you, and they want you dead or alive.
Now, go on, and go quickly. And don't venture
back, lest you die!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ka pai koe!</i>" ("You are good!") was all
Hiroki said. Turning, he went quickly at a half-trot
along the path, with his gun at the trail, and
his wild-looking, mongrel dog close on his bare heels,
and in a few moments both disappeared in the
dark forest.</p>

<p>Bent and Pakanga returned to the pursuing
party, who were becoming impatient at the long
absence of their guide and were hot with questions.</p>

<p>The white man and his companions managed to
quiet the suspicions of the man-hunters. They declared
that there were no signs of any one having
passed that way, and that it would not be much
use going on to the Ngaere, which was a long and
very toilsome journey. Fortunately for them, the
half-caste and his men had not troubled to go on
as far as the big <i>totara</i> on the river-bank, where the
tell-tale fire was not yet cold.</p>

<p>After some debate the whole party returned to
Rukumoana, and the hunters, giving up the chase
in that direction, made out to the open country,
and that was the last Bent heard of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Three years later Bent met Hiroki in Parihaka,
the village of the prophet Te Whiti. The slayer
of McLean had had a wild and anxious life of it
after his escape from Rukumoana. He told Bent
of his lonely existence in the great forests of the
back-country, living on eels, wild honey, the young
shoots of fern-trees, and such-like rough fare of the
bush. After he came out into the open country
and was making his way across the Waimate Plains
in the direction of Parihaka he was chased by several
Government men (one of whom was Mr. William
Williams, a Plains settler), and was fired at and
wounded, but escaped. Te Whiti sheltered him
and condoned his crime, which, being a semi-agrarian
one, was counted a patriotic deed by the people
of Parihaka. He spoke gratefully of what Bent
had done for him, in giving him timely warning
that day in the Mangamingi bush, and offered him
a money gift as some measure of <i>utu</i>. This Bent
promptly refused, saying, "Keep your money, and
thank the <i>Atua</i> for your escape, not me."</p>

<p>Hiroki was a wild figure in Parihaka those lawless
days of 1878-81. On meeting-days and feast-days,
when the faithful of the Maori tribes gathered to
hear the prophet expound the Scriptures after his
fashion and prophesy many strange happenings,
the Lean One used to head the procession of the
<i>tuku-kai</i>, the bringing of the food for ceremonious
presentation to the visitors. A double line of gaily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
dressed girls, bearing baskets of potatoes and pork
and fish hot from the <i>hangi</i>, marched in time to a
lively song into the <i>marae</i>, and in front of them
paraded Hiroki, stripped to a loin-mat, a loaded
and cocked double-barrelled gun in his hands, white
feathers stuck in his hair, red war-paint on his
cheeks and forehead, leaping from side to side, eyes
rolling, tongue defiantly protruded, the embodiment
of Maori savagery and ferocity. But when
John Bryce, as native minister, invaded Parihaka
in 1881 with his force of 1,700 Armed Constabulary
and Volunteers, and arrested the two prophets Te
Whiti and Tohu, Hiroki was also captured, and
shortly thereafter he was tried for McLean's murder
and was hanged.</p>

<p>To this day the Maoris of the Patea tell stories of
Hiroki's solitary and savage life in the bush. One
place in particular&mdash;at Orangimura, between three
and four miles above Rukumoana&mdash;is pointed out
as a hiding-place of the refugee. Here a large,
hollow <i>rata</i>-tree grew near the top of a high bank;
the Patea River flowed below. Hiroki had camped
here in order to get wild honey from a hive in the
hollow tree, and after he had filled a couple of calabashes
with the honey he lit his nightly fire and went
to sleep close to the cliff-top, first tying his dog up
to a bush with a flax rope. In the night the dog
bit through the flax that held him, and jumping on
his master so startled him that he forgot he was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
near the verge of the cliff, over which he promptly
rolled in the darkness; he fell with a mighty splash
in the river below, together with his astonished dog.
The spot where this night adventure occurred is
called by the Maoris Te Pari-o-Hiroki, which means
"Hiroki's Precipice."</p>

<p class="center">OUT OF EXILE</p>

<p class="blockquote">Canoeing on the Patea&mdash;The voyage to Hukatéré&mdash;The white man's
world again&mdash;Bent the medicine-man&mdash;<i>Makutu</i>, or the Black
Art&mdash;Bent's later days&mdash;The end.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">All</span> was ready for the voyage, and the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori
and his companions loaded their canoe and
embarked for Hukatéré&mdash;thirty miles down-stream,
not far from the sea-coast. The Patea was a very
winding stream, flowing between high forest-covered
banks; its course was impeded by frequent
rocky shoals and accumulations of sunken logs,
which formed rapids. Aboard the canoe, besides
Bent, were Rupé, Hakopa and his niece, and a
man named Te Rii, who was an <i>urukehu</i>, or "fair
hair."</p>

<p>The white man and his Maori companions paddled
along merrily for seven or eight miles, lightening
their labours with canoe-songs. Then, in shooting
a rapid, the canoe struck a rock, swung broadside on
to the swift current, and immediately capsized.</p>

<p>The crew reached the shore safely, and hauled
the canoe up on to a shingly bank. Fortunately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
all the cargo&mdash;the baskets of dried eels and the
calabashes filled with honey&mdash;had been made fast
to the thwarts, as a precaution against such an
accident, and so was saved; but old Hakopa lost
a little kit&mdash;his bush savings-bank&mdash;containing a
sum of money which he had acquired at the Waitara.
On the bank a fire was kindled by means of flint
and steel&mdash;commonly used amongst the Maoris in
those days, and still occasionally seen in use in
remote forest districts, such as the Urewera Country.
By the blaze of the great fire the wrecked canoeists
dried themselves and their garments, and they
camped there that night.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning they embarked again,
and another day and a half at the paddles took
them down to the Hukatéré <i>kainga</i>, a large settlement
of <i>raupo</i>-thatched houses, standing on the
left bank of the Patea, in a beautiful bend, with the
lofty, forest-fringed cliffs of Pariroa jutting out
abruptly on the opposite shore.</p>

<p>The approaching canoe, its four paddles flashing
in the sun and dipping again all together, was seen
from the <i>kainga</i> while still some little distance up
the river, and the men and women of the Hukatéré
gathered on the water-side and cried and waved
their welcome to the long-absent people of the bush.</p>

<p>"<i>Kumea mai te waka!</i>" they chanted, and the
women waved shawls and green branches in the
poetic greeting of the <i>powhiri</i>. "<i>To-o-ia mai te
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
waka!</i> Oh, haul up the canoe! Draw hitherwards
the canoe. To the resting-place&mdash;that canoe! To
the sleeping-place&mdash;that canoe! Oh, welcome, welcome,
strangers from the forest-land! Urge swift
your paddles, for home darts your canoe!"</p>

<p>So, chanting their ancient song, the villagers received
the new arrivals, and, still waving their garments
and their leafy branches, retired slowly before
them as they landed and walked up the sloping
banks until the open <i>marae</i> in the centre of the
<i>kainga</i> was reached. There the guests from Rukumoana
were received by a dignified chief, white-bearded
old Nga-waka-taurua (Double-canoe). Now
the <i>powhiri</i> was succeeded by the doleful sounds
of the <i>tangi</i>, and one after another the Hukatéré
tribespeople pressed their noses to those of Rupé
and his household; and they wept long and unrestrainedly
for the dead, for those who had passed
away since they last met.</p>

<p>And then the feasting. The bush-family and
their "tame white man" enjoyed a meal of truly
huge proportions and variety in comparison with
the meagre forest-fare to which they had been confined
so long. And when the <i>pakeha</i> tobacco and
<i>pakeha</i> grog came out&mdash;unwonted luxuries to the
<i>mohoao</i>, the bush-people&mdash;old Rupé and his household
were indeed in the Promised Land for which
they had longed for many a month; they had all
that the heart of the Hauhau could desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>The feast over, the dried eels and honey, conveyed
with so much toil from distant Rukumoana, were
brought up to the <i>marae</i>, and ceremoniously presented
to old "Double-Canoe," who distributed the
food amongst the people of the village. The canoe
itself was similarly presented to the chief as a gift
of <i>aroha</i> from Rupé. In return, the men of Hukatéré
placed before the visitors their gifts&mdash;£5 in
money (representing the sum total of the <i>pakeha</i>
cash in the village), and blankets, shirts, and other
articles of clothing, of which Bent and his companions
were in much need after their rough life in
the bush.</p>

<p>"While I was in the <i>kainga</i>," says Bent, "the
local chief went down to the town of Patea, a few
miles away, to get me some European clothing.
He informed some people in the town that Tu-nui-a-moa,
the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori, who had been with the
Hauhaus for twelve or thirteen years, was in his
<i>kainga</i>, and next day about twenty Europeans rode
up to the settlement out of curiosity to see me.
We had a long talk, and they gave me some articles
of clothing, and told me all about the white man's
world from which I had cut myself off. This was
about the end of the year 1878.</p>

<p>"After a month's stay we returned to our own
village, in a canoe belonging to the Hukatéré
natives, loaded with goods and 'tucker.' Five days'
paddling and poling up-river took us to Rukumoana.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Planting season came round again; then
we whiled away the time in Maori fashion&mdash;hunting
wild pigs, snaring and shooting birds, catching
eels, and getting honey&mdash;until the crops were harvested.
And not long after that we bade farewell
to our old <i>kainga</i> for ever, loaded our canoe for the
last time, and once more paddled down to Hukatéré."</p>

  <div class="caption">KIMBLE BENT, THE PAKEHA-MAORI.<br />
    (<i>From a photo taken in 1903.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>From Hukatéré the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori and his girl-wife
went to Taiporohenui&mdash;Bent's old home in the
war days. There he lived for a year or so, blanketed
like a Maori, and working in the cultivations.
Here, too, in the long nights he was much with the
old men of the <i>kainga</i>, and from such learned men
as Hupini and Pokau&mdash;true <i>tohungas</i>, or priests, and
soothsayers&mdash;he learned much of the strange occultism
of the Maori. He saw singular ceremonies,
the rites of the <i>makutu</i>, the black art. He learned
scores of <i>karakias</i>&mdash;incantations useful in Maori
eyes for all sorts of purposes, all conditions of war
and peace time. Some of these were <i>makutu</i> spells
by which the wizard could slay an enemy, by witchcraft
and the power of the evil eye. Many a case
of death from <i>makutu</i> came under Bent's observation
during his life among the Maoris. Old Hupini,
says the <i>pakeha</i>-Maori, undoubtedly killed men
with his <i>makutu</i>&mdash;a combination of three factors:
projection of the will force, the malignant exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
of hypnotic influence, and sheer imagination and
fright on the part of the person <i>makutu</i>'d.</p>

<p>Many Maoris believe that the witchcraft can be
wrought by an adept or <i>tohunga</i> by taking some of
the hair or clothing or even remains of the food of
the person intended to be slain, and pronouncing
the appropriate powerful <i>karakias</i> and curses over
it. The enemy's <i>hau</i>&mdash;his life-essence, his vital
force&mdash;then lies in the hollow of the <i>tohunga's</i>
hand.</p>

<p>A <i>tohunga</i> can take the <i>hau</i> of a man's footprints
and thereby <i>makutu</i> him; he can even <i>makutu</i> an
enemy's horse so that it will fall sick and not be
able to travel!</p>

<p>Amongst the prayers and ceremonies which old
Hupini taught Bent were the <i>karakia</i> for combating
the evil spell of the <i>makutu</i> and for restoring a bewitched
and ailing person to health and safety&mdash;to
the Land of Light and Life, the <i>Ao-marama</i>.</p>

<p>One of these rites Bent describes in true Maori
fashion:</p>

<p>A person is taken seriously ill; it is the <i>makutu</i>.
The wise man is called in; he divines that the illness
is caused by another <i>tohunga's</i> witchcraft. At
daylight in the morning the sick man is carried to
the water-side. The wise man then takes three
small sticks or twigs (<i>rito</i>)&mdash;fern-sticks will do&mdash;and
sets them up by the side of the river or the pool.
One of these sacred wands represents the invalid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
one the tribe to which he belongs, and one the
mischief-working wizard (<i>te tangata nana te makutu</i>).
A charm is said over them, and then two <i>rito</i> are
taken away, leaving only one&mdash;that for the wizard&mdash;the
"wand of darkness."</p>

<p>An incantation, beginning:</p>

<p>"<i>Toko i te po, te po nui, te po roa</i>" ("Staff of the
night, the great night, the long night"), etc., is
repeated over this wand. When this is said the
priest conducts the sick person to the edge of the
water and sprinkles water over his body, repeating
as he does so a charm to expel the <i>makutu</i> spirits
from his body, ending with a curse upon the malevolent
wizard&mdash;"Eat that <i>tohunga makutu</i>, let him
be utterly eaten and destroyed."</p>

<p>When this is ended the patient is taken back to
his house. He is told that the wise man has, by
virtue of his very strong charms, seen the rival
<i>tohunga makutu</i>, and that it will not be long before
that evil man dies. The curse falls, the wizard is
himself <i>makutu</i>'d, and the invalid&mdash;perhaps&mdash;recovers.</p>

<p>About the year 1881 Bent&mdash;now able to venture
into the towns of the <i>pakeha</i> again in safety&mdash;left
Taranaki, and travelled to Auckland and up to the
Waikato. Then he went on to the west coast, and
spent some months amongst the Maoris of the
Ngati-Mahuta tribe, living in the historic old settlement
Maketu, on the shores of Kawhia Harbour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
close to the legendary landing-place of the Tainui
canoe&mdash;the Waikato Maoris' pilgrim ship.</p>

<p>Tawhiao, the Maori King, was then living at
Kawhia, and he asked Bent to remain with him and
be his <i>pakeha</i> and interpreter. The white man was
now, however, wearying to be back in his old home,
Taranaki.</p>

<p>"Tawhiao," says Bent, "insisted on me remaining
with his tribe, but I repeated a Maori incantation
which I had been taught by the <i>tohungas</i> in
Taranaki, a <i>karakia</i> used as a charm by strangers
(<i>tangata tauhou</i>) who may desire to leave the place
where they are staying on a visit and proceed to a
new <i>pa</i>, and who fear obstruction. The charm
begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">"'<i>Ka u, ka u, ki tenei tauhou,</i></div>
      <div class="verse indent-2_6"><i>Ki tenei whenua tauhou.</i>'</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"When the old king heard me repeat the incantation
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Ha, so you are a <i>tohunga</i>!'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I am,' I replied.</p>

<p>"Then the old man said, '<i>Kua tuwhera te rori
mou</i>' ('The road is open to you.') He permitted
me to return to Taranaki, and sent four of his men
to escort me through the King Country to Waitara."</p>

<p>The last quarter-century of Kimble Bent's life
has not carried much adventure. Living amongst
the Maoris, he acquired some reputation as a
"medicine-man." During his wild life in Maoridom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
he had become expert in the rude pharmacop&oelig;ia
of the bush, and learned to extract potent
medicines from the plants of the forest. Native
herbs and tree-bark and leaves, prepared in various
ways, are exceedingly valuable remedies. The
knowledge of these herbal remedies, gained from
many a <i>tohunga</i> and wise woman of the bush tribes,
the white man now turned to practical account.
His fame as a doctor reached Parihaka, the village
of Te Whiti, the Prophet of the Mountain. The
prophet's people sent for the white medicine-man
to come and heal the sick. He spent a week in
Parihaka, and returned to his Taiporohenui hut
with more money in his pocket than he had possessed
since he left his old home-town of Eastport
to see life in England. "And I was luckier than
most <i>pakeha</i> doctors," says the old man, "for none
of my patients died!"</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>And so the tale of "Tu-nui-a-moa" is told, and
we take our leave of the old <i>pakeha</i>-Maori&mdash;Kimble
Bent, sailor, soldier, outlaw, Hauhau slave, cartridge-maker,
<i>pa</i>-builder, canoe-carver, medicine-man,
and what not&mdash;sitting smoking his pipe in
the midst of his Maori friends. He is still living
with the natives; working in their food-gardens,
fishing with them, house-building for them. A grey
old man, of mild and quiet eye, who might easily
be taken for some highly respectable shopkeeper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
who had spent all his life in city bounds. Yet no
man probably has lived a wilder life, using the
term in the sense of an intimate acquaintance with
primeval, passionate savagery, and with the ever-near
face of death. He is the sole living white
eye-witness of the secret Hauhau war-rites; the
only white man who has survived to tell of those
terrible deeds in the bush, to tell the story of the
last Taranaki war from the inner side&mdash;the Maori
side.</p>

<p>Bent has reached the age of seventy-three; and
now the old man's thoughts go to his boyhood's
home in the far-off State of Maine, and he sometimes
expresses a wish to reach his homeland again.
"If I could only get a berth on some American
sailing-vessel bound for New York or Boston, I'd
even now try to work my passage home," he says.
"I'd like to die in my mother's land." But that
can never be. He is for ever beyond the pale; and
he will die as he has lived, a <i>pakeha</i>-Maori.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX</a></h2>

<p class="center">TITOKOWARU, THE TARANAKI WAR-CHIEF</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following interesting supplementary particulars concerning
Titokowaru, one of the leading figures in this book,
were supplied to the writer by the Rev. T. G. Hammond,
of Opunake, Wesleyan missionary to the Taranaki Maoris:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"It was Titokowaru's right eye that had been destroyed by a bullet
in some engagement. He was about five feet nine in height and
somewhat spare and muscular, with fine bone, an alert, active
man, but by no means good-looking. His skin was rather darker
than the general run of Maoris, and his nose low in the bridge,
with wide nostrils. His face rarely lit up pleasantly, and he
was of reserved manner. His knowledge of <i>tikanga Maori</i> was
considerable, and during the war he conducted the usual ceremonies
to make the war-parties successful.</p>

<p>"The late Rev. Stannard, of Wanganui, told me that Titokowaru's
name given him in baptism was <i>Hohepa</i> (Joseph), and I have heard
from Tairuakena and others that Tito was one of the young men who
accompanied the Rev. Skevington on his last visit to Auckland.
(This was long before the Maori War.) They journeyed overland
from Te Waimate to Auckland, Mr. Skevington going to attend the
Auckland Synod. While in the old High Street Church, Auckland,
he died suddenly. Titokowaru and the other young men returned to
bear the news to the people, as he (Tairuakena) put it, '<i>Ka hoki
mai matou tangi, haere ki tena kainga, ki tena kainga.</i>' Mr. Woon
succeeded Mr. Skevington at Heretoa, Te Waimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">"I had one interview with Titokowaru which I shall never forget.
I think it was in 1876, and before I knew Maori. Mr. William
Williams, of Manaia, Taranaki, was going to visit Titokowaru at
Omuturangi, on the Waimate Plains, and, as I was on my way to New
Plymouth, he persuaded me to delay a day and go with him&mdash;a most
unwise thing, as the Maoris had said they would shoot any one who
crossed the Wai-ngongoro. We went from Hawera to Normanby, and then
picked up old K&#257;tené Tu-Whakaruru, who was just then acting as
a Maori policeman. We rode along over these vast plains, with the
cocksfoot brushing against our knees as we sat in our saddles. We
came to a house on the edge of the bush, and found only one woman,
whose face was deeply scarred; she had lately lost her child, and
had been cutting herself in her grief. This woman told us that
Titokowaru and the men were in the bush planting potatoes, and
pointed out a narrow path, along which we galloped for a good
distance, perhaps a mile.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Suddenly we came upon about eighty Maoris, all men, and
Titokowaru with them. They gathered round us as we dismounted, and
Titokowaru came and took my right arm, and a big burly fellow my
left. They sat me between them, holding me fast, while the smoke
from the fire close by almost smothered me. An old bald-headed
Maori began to speak in an excited manner, and when he had done
a very rascally looking young fellow made a speech, coming up to
me and smacking his thigh, and letting out an angry grunt at the
end of every period. When he finished, K&#257;tené spoke, and did
his best to turn away their anger; reminded them of the good the
missionaries did in getting them released from bondage in the
Waikato and the Ngapuhi Country.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Then Williams spoke, and at the close of his speech a fine man
in a <i>piupiu</i> (flax waist-mat) orated, and then came forward
to <i>hongi</i> (rub noses) with me. After which there was a little
fraternisation, and we came away. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
old K&#257;tené looked very white while the row was on, but I did
not know enough to be scared. It was a narrow escape; I, of
course, know now what I did not know then. I thought at the time
Titokowaru was protecting me, but I think now he was making sure
that I did not get away."</p>


<p>Titokowaru died at his village near Manaia, on the
Waimate Plains&mdash;the scene of his olden battles against
the whites&mdash;towards the end of 1889. To the end he was
a sturdy enemy of the Europeans, and though he did not
actually fight against them after 1869, he was the leader
in many obstructive movements against white settlement,
surveying, and road-making.</p>


<p class="center">REWARD FOR TITOKOWARU'S HEAD</p>

<p>Under address and date Downing Street, February 26th,
1869, the Right Hon. Earl Granville, K.G., Secretary of
State for the Colonies, wrote to Sir George F. Bowen,
G.C.M.G., Governor of New Zealand:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"I see it stated in the newspapers that you have offered a reward
of £1,000 for the person of the Maori chief Titokowaru&mdash;I infer
alive or dead&mdash;and £5 for the person of every Maori rebel brought
in alive. I do not at present pronounce any opinion as to the
propriety of these steps, but I must observe that they are so
much at variance with the usual laws of war, and appear, at first
sight, so much calculated to exasperate and extend hostilities,
that they ought to have been reported to me by you officially with
the requisite explanation, which I should now be glad to receive."</p>

<p>In the course of his reply to this despatch Governor
Bowen said:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"It is contended that this passage implies that the Maoris now in
arms ... are foreign enemies, or at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
events belligerents, with
whom the usual laws of war must be strictly observed."
</p>

<p>On this, Earl Granville remarked in a despatch of
November 4th:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"I think you would have done well to point out to those who
thus argue that my despatch nowhere hints that the Maoris are
foreigners, a doctrine which I had never heard of before I
perused the Attorney-General's opinion; and that the legitimate
inference from my despatch is the direct contrary to that which
is drawn from it.... I do not clearly understand how you justify
this notice as a matter of law. I understand you to disclaim the
application of martial law; and viewing Titokowaru merely as a
notorious, but untried and unconvicted rebel and murderer, I am
not aware of any Colonial enactment which would make it lawful for
any chance person to shoot him down."

We have survivals of this widespread ancient custom amongst
ourselves, in the practice of placing coins, etc., under the foot
of a mast of a new ship, and under the foundation-stone of a
church or other important building. The cult is found amongst many
savage nations in its primitive form. Here is an instance narrated
by Mr. T. C. Hodson in an article in <i>Folk-Lore</i> (Vol. XX., No.
2, 1909) on "Head-hunting amongst the Hill-tribes of Assam": "The
head-man of a large and powerful village (on the frontier of the
State of Manipur) was engaged in building himself a new house, and
to strengthen it had seized this man (a Naga) and forcibly cut off
a lock of his hair, which had been buried underneath the main post
of the house. In olden days the head would have been put there,
but by a refinement of some native theologian a lock of hair was
held as good as the whole head."
<br /><br />
It was the olden Maori custom to place a human head beneath the
central pillar of a sacred building, and to have a human sacrifice
at the opening of a new house.

Compare this with the ingenious form of "spring-gun" which an
English exploring expedition found in use in 1910 amongst the
Negrito pigmies on the slopes of the Snow Mountains, in New
Guinea. This spring-gun is made by setting a flattened bamboo
spear against a bent sapling, fastened to a trigger in such a
way that it is released by the passer-by stumbling against an
invisible string stretched across a game-track. These hardened
bamboo spears inflict serious wounds, as they are launched with

Of this Hauhau Colonel W. E. Gudgeon wrote in the Polynesian
Society's <i>Journal</i>, No. 59 (Sept. 1906): "Had there been but
ten men of the stamp of Takitaki the redoubt must have been taken;
but luckily there were not, and therefore a mere handful of men
held the redoubt to the end."

The following account of Major von Tempsky's death, given in
Auckland by Mr. James Shanaghan, who fought at Te-Ngutu-o-te-Manu
as an A.C. private, and was wounded while attempting to rescue the
major's body, is worth placing beside the Maori story for purposes
of comparison. It is the most circumstantial narrative of von
Tempsky's end ever given by a European survivor of the bush-battle:
<br />
"Our brave old major was walking to and fro with his sword in
hand, furious at being caged as he was. I met him and he spoke to
me in his kindly, thoughtful way, and asked why I did not take
cover. I answered by putting the same question to him. He then
said, 'I am disgusted. If I get out of this scrape I will wash
my hands clear of the business.' He then sent me to take up a
position and keep my eyes open, as the bullets were coming thick.
I left him to obey the last order he ever gave. I had not gone
far when a man of our Company was shot. The major went to his
assistance and was shot, the bullet entering the centre of his
forehead. He fell dead on top of the man to whose assistance he
was going. That was how von Tempsky died.
<br /><br />
"A Frenchman named Jancey and I went to the major and lifted
him up and laid him on his back, and just as we did so a bullet
struck Jancey on the side and travelled across his breastbone,
and another struck the cartridge-box he had on his back. I
left von Tempsky and picked up Jancey, carrying him out across
the clearing. I then met Lieutenant Hunter (of the Wellington
Rangers), and when we were about ten paces from von Tempsky's body
Hunter was shot dead. I got hold of him and started to pull him
back. Then I said to one of our men, 'Come along for Major von
Tempsky's body.' This man refused, but Captain Buck (Wellington
Rifles) came up and asked if I knew where von Tempsky was. I
said, 'Yes,' and he said, 'Come along, lad, let's get him out.'
When we came to the body I was hit by a bullet on the left thumb,
which was shot nearly off. Just as I changed the carbine to my
other hand a bullet went through my left hand and struck the
carbine-stock, knocking me backwards. Then Buck was shot dead,
and as I got up a bullet took my cap off. I got away from the
clearing, leaving von Tempsky and Buck dead together. There were
four of us who went for von Tempsky's body; Jancey and I were
wounded, and Hunter and Buck were killed."

Colonel W. E. Gudgeon writes me: "For the number engaged Moturoa
was the most desperate engagement fought in the Maori War.
Whitmore's return did not give nearly our losses. I made it at the
time fifty-two out of less than two hundred actually engaged. At
Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu all did not behave well, but at Moturoa any one
might have been proud of the men. No force in the world could have
behaved better."

The Taranaki Maoris used to cultivate the <i>mamaku</i> fern-tree
for the sake of the edible pith. The natives point out one of the
olden <i>mamaku</i> grounds just to the north of Keteonetea (near
the present township of Normanby), where the old Whakaahurangi
track went in towards Mount Egmont. Here there were two or three
miles of <i>mamaku</i> forest. The Maoris used to cut off the upper
parts of the trees and plant them in the ground, thus making
two <i>mamaku</i> grow where only one grew before. The old tree so
decapitated always sent out a new head.

This name <i>Rukumoana</i> originated thus, according to the
Maoris: About the year 1830 a war-party from the Waikato attacked
and slaughtered a number of Taranaki people here. One of the
Taranakis saved his own life and that of his brother in a
remarkable manner. These two men were cousins of Hakopa, the old
warrior who befriended Kimble Bent in Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu <i>pa</i> in
1868, and later on the Waitara. One of the men was wounded, and in
another moment his head would have been slashed off by a Waikato
savage, but his brother seized him in his arms, and leaped over
the steep bank of the Patea into the river below. He dived to the
bottom, and still holding his brother, crawled along the bottom
until he reached a place under the banks where the overhanging
shrubs concealed them from view. The pursuers failed to find the
brothers, who presently escaped to the forest. The Taranaki people
commemorated this heroic deed by naming the spot where Hakopa's
cousin took his daring leap "Rukumoana" ("Deep-Sea Diving").
